Matthew Cooper [url=https:/us.battle.net/forums/en/heroes/topic/20752266255]detailed the changes on our forums[/url] last month explaining a bit about the new system. While the tooltips may have changed, the actual functionality for the system has been in since the Varian patch hit during the week of November 14, so the game itself should not feel any different than what you are currently used to. You will also notice that we have added baseline Armor to three Heroes – Arthas, Anub'arak, and Greymane’s Worgen Form. These are the first of a handful that we are planning to release and would love to hear any feedback you have. We are hoping that the Armor System will open up future design flexibility, increase the depth of strategy (both in game, and in draft), and grant us another knob to help balance the game.

We are still heavily evaluating a lot of it but wanted to get the first round of changes in. Internally, we enjoyed the increased importance on Regeneration Globes and have cleaned up the system a bit. With a larger importance, denying enemies their Globes in lane has a much larger impact.  [b]Healing Wells[/b] [list] [*]Cooldown increased from 100 to 120 seconds [*][b]Health Regeneration[/b] [list] Previously: Restore 41% of maximum Health over 20 seconds. [*]Now: Restore 40% of maximum Health over 20 seconds. [/list] [*][b]Mana Regeneration[/b] [list] Previously: Restore 20% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds. [*]Now: Restore 30% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Much like the changes to Regeneration Globes, we wanted to add a larger impact to the moment you click a Healing Well. Again, we cleaned up the system a fair bit (hence the ~41% to 40% Health change) and added a larger impact for heavy Mana users. The increased cooldown should make the decision of when to tap the Healing Well slightly more interesting.  [b]Minions[/b] [list] [*][b]Ranged, Melee, and Wizard Minions[/b] [list] Now deal an additional 50% damage to Structures. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Our goal with this change is to make escorting Minions to Towns to be more impactful, such that they can really start to do some damage if left unattended. Before this change, Minions were primarily XP carriers that absorbed some Ammo shots from Towers. Now the armies of the Nexus are a bit scarier when they march down a lane.  [list] [*][b]Catapult Minions[/b] [list] Attack range increased by 20%. [*]Sight range increased by 17%. [*]Will now fixate on Structures. Catapults will not acquire a new target after fixating until the target is destroyed or the Catapult is killed. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Catapults would often reach the Core, but have a Minion wave spawn on them, distract them, and allow them to be killed off before doing any significant damage. With increased range and fixation on a Structure once they’ve started attacking, even one Catapult will more consistently punch through a Core’s Shield and do actual damage.

[*]A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values. [list] Please review our recent [url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095]blog on scaling and respawn timer changes[/url] for more details. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked. This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead. We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios. As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level. Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously. The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game. Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game. It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.  [b]Respawn Timers[/b] [list] [*]Respawn timers have been increased for levels 1 – 10.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] In order to reward players for getting early game Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead, early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries. These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory, without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the opposing enemy team.

Matthew Cooper [url=https:/us.battle.net/forums/en/heroes/topic/20752266255]detailed the changes on our forums[/url] last month explaining a bit about the new system. While the tooltips may have changed, the actual functionality for the system has been in since the Varian patch hit during the week of November 14, so the game itself should not feel any different than what you are currently used to. You will also notice that we have added baseline Armor to three Heroes – Arthas, Anub'arak, and Greymane’s Worgen Form. These are the first of a handful that we are planning to release and would love to hear any feedback you have. We are hoping that the Armor System will open up future design flexibility, increase the depth of strategy (both in game, and in draft), and grant us another knob to help balance the game.

We are still heavily evaluating a lot of it but wanted to get the first round of changes in. Internally, we enjoyed the increased importance on Regeneration Globes and have cleaned up the system a bit. With a larger importance, denying enemies their Globes in lane has a much larger impact.  [b]Healing Wells[/b] [list] [*]Cooldown increased from 100 to 120 seconds [*][b]Health Regeneration[/b] [list] Previously: Restore 41% of maximum Health over 20 seconds.

[*]Now: Restore 30% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Much like the changes to Regeneration Globes, we wanted to add a larger impact to the moment you click a Healing Well. Again, we cleaned up the system a fair bit (hence the ~41% to 40% Health change) and added a larger impact for heavy Mana users. The increased cooldown should make the decision of when to tap the Healing Well slightly more interesting.  [b]Minions[/b] [list] [*][b]Ranged, Melee, and Wizard Minions[/b] [list] Now deal an additional 50% damage to Structures. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Our goal with this change is to make escorting Minions to Towns to be more impactful, such that they can really start to do some damage if left unattended. Before this change, Minions were primarily XP carriers that absorbed some Ammo shots from Towers. Now the armies of the Nexus are a bit scarier when they march down a lane.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Catapults would often reach the Core, but have a Minion wave spawn on them, distract them, and allow them to be killed off before doing any significant damage. With increased range and fixation on a Structure once they’ve started attacking, even one Catapult will more consistently punch through a Core’s Shield and do actual damage.

[*]A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values. [list] Please review our recent [url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095]blog on scaling and respawn timer changes[/url] for more details. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked. This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead. We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios. As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level. Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously. The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game. Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game. It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.  [b]Respawn Timers[/b] [list] [*]Respawn timers have been increased for levels 1 – 10.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] In order to reward players for getting early game Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead, early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries. These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory, without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the opposing enemy team.

We are still heavily evaluating a lot of it but wanted to get the first round of changes in.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Much like the changes to Regeneration Globes, we wanted to add a larger impact to the moment you click a Healing Well. Again, we cleaned up the system a fair bit (hence the ~41% to 40% Health change) and added a larger impact for heavy Mana users. The increased cooldown should make the decision of when to tap the Healing Well slightly more interesting.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Our goal with this change is to make escorting Minions to Towns to be more impactful, such that they can really start to do some damage if left unattended. Before this change, Minions were primarily XP carriers that absorbed some Ammo shots from Towers. Now the armies of the Nexus are a bit scarier when they march down a lane.

With increased range and fixation on a Structure once they’ve started attacking, even one Catapult will more consistently punch through a Core’s Shield and do actual damage.

[*]A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values. [list] Please review our recent [url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095]blog on scaling and respawn timer changes[/url] for more details. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked. This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead. We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios. As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level. Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously. The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game. Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game. It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.  [b]Respawn Timers[/b] [list] [*]Respawn timers have been increased for levels 1 – 10.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] In order to reward players for getting early game Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead, early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries. These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory, without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the opposing enemy team.

We are still heavily evaluating a lot of it but wanted to get the first round of changes in. Internally, we enjoyed the increased importance on Regeneration Globes and have cleaned up the system a bit. With a larger importance, denying enemies their Globes in lane has a much larger impact.  [b]Healing Wells[/b] [list] [*]Cooldown increased from 100 to 120 seconds [*][b]Health Regeneration[/b] [list] Previously: Restore 41% of maximum Health over 20 seconds. [*]Now: Restore 40% of maximum Health over 20 seconds. [/list] [*][b]Mana Regeneration[/b] [list] Previously: Restore 20% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds. [*]Now: Restore 30% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Much like the changes to Regeneration Globes, we wanted to add a larger impact to the moment you click a Healing Well. Again, we cleaned up the system a fair bit (hence the ~41% to 40% Health change) and added a larger impact for heavy Mana users. The increased cooldown should make the decision of when to tap the Healing Well slightly more interesting.  [b]Minions[/b] [list] [*][b]Ranged, Melee, and Wizard Minions[/b] [list] Now deal an additional 50% damage to Structures. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Our goal with this change is to make escorting Minions to Towns to be more impactful, such that they can really start to do some damage if left unattended. Before this change, Minions were primarily XP carriers that absorbed some Ammo shots from Towers. Now the armies of the Nexus are a bit scarier when they march down a lane.  [list] [*][b]Catapult Minions[/b] [list] Attack range increased by 20%. [*]Sight range increased by 17%. [*]Will now fixate on Structures. Catapults will not acquire a new target after fixating until the target is destroyed or the Catapult is killed. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Catapults would often reach the Core, but have a Minion wave spawn on them, distract them, and allow them to be killed off before doing any significant damage. With increased range and fixation on a Structure once they’ve started attacking, even one Catapult will more consistently punch through a Core’s Shield and do actual damage.

While we’re okay with players doing this to a degree, we found it was too effective given how little counterplay there was. To help solve this, turned a sizable portion of Healing Well Health into a Shield. This means that if you offer your Healing Well some respite from enemy attacks by chasing opponents away every now and then, it will start to regenerate some of that Shield.

While early event Punishers should be a bit stronger, any event past the 15-minute mark should be identical to those from the previous patch.

[*]A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values. [list] Please review our recent [url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095]blog on scaling and respawn timer changes[/url] for more details. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked. This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead. We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios. As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level. Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously. The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game. Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game. It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.  [b]Respawn Timers[/b] [list] [*]Respawn timers have been increased for levels 1 – 10.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] In order to reward players for getting early game Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead, early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries. These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory, without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the opposing enemy team.

These are the first of a handful that we are planning to release and would love to hear any feedback you have. We are hoping that the Armor System will open up future design flexibility, increase the depth of strategy (both in game, and in draft), and grant us another knob to help balance the game.

We are still heavily evaluating a lot of it but wanted to get the first round of changes in. Internally, we enjoyed the increased importance on Regeneration Globes and have cleaned up the system a bit. With a larger importance, denying enemies their Globes in lane has a much larger impact.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Much like the changes to Regeneration Globes, we wanted to add a larger impact to the moment you click a Healing Well. Again, we cleaned up the system a fair bit (hence the ~41% to 40% Health change) and added a larger impact for heavy Mana users. The increased cooldown should make the decision of when to tap the Healing Well slightly more interesting.  [b]Minions[/b] [list] [*][b]Ranged, Melee, and Wizard Minions[/b] [list] Now deal an additional 50% damage to Structures. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Our goal with this change is to make escorting Minions to Towns to be more impactful, such that they can really start to do some damage if left unattended. Before this change, Minions were primarily XP carriers that absorbed some Ammo shots from Towers. Now the armies of the Nexus are a bit scarier when they march down a lane.

With increased range and fixation on a Structure once they’ve started attacking, even one Catapult will more consistently punch through a Core’s Shield and do actual damage.

[*]A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values. [list] Please review our recent [url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095]blog on scaling and respawn timer changes[/url] for more details. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked. This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead. We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios. As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level. Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously. The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game. Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game. It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.  [b]Respawn Timers[/b] [list] [*]Respawn timers have been increased for levels 1 – 10.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] In order to reward players for getting early game Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead, early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries. These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory, without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the opposing enemy team.

Matthew Cooper [url=https:/us.battle.net/forums/en/heroes/topic/20752266255]detailed the changes on our forums[/url] last month explaining a bit about the new system. While the tooltips may have changed, the actual functionality for the system has been in since the Varian patch hit during the week of November 14, so the game itself should not feel any different than what you are currently used to. You will also notice that we have added baseline Armor to three Heroes – Arthas, Anub'arak, and Greymane’s Worgen Form. These are the first of a handful that we are planning to release and would love to hear any feedback you have. We are hoping that the Armor System will open up future design flexibility, increase the depth of strategy (both in game, and in draft), and grant us another knob to help balance the game.

We are still heavily evaluating a lot of it but wanted to get the first round of changes in. Internally, we enjoyed the increased importance on Regeneration Globes and have cleaned up the system a bit. With a larger importance, denying enemies their Globes in lane has a much larger impact.  [b]Healing Wells[/b] [list] [*]Cooldown increased from 100 to 120 seconds [*][b]Health Regeneration[/b] [list] Previously: Restore 41% of maximum Health over 20 seconds.

[*]Now: Restore 30% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Much like the changes to Regeneration Globes, we wanted to add a larger impact to the moment you click a Healing Well. Again, we cleaned up the system a fair bit (hence the ~41% to 40% Health change) and added a larger impact for heavy Mana users. The increased cooldown should make the decision of when to tap the Healing Well slightly more interesting.  [b]Minions[/b] [list] [*][b]Ranged, Melee, and Wizard Minions[/b] [list] Now deal an additional 50% damage to Structures. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Our goal with this change is to make escorting Minions to Towns to be more impactful, such that they can really start to do some damage if left unattended. Before this change, Minions were primarily XP carriers that absorbed some Ammo shots from Towers. Now the armies of the Nexus are a bit scarier when they march down a lane.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Catapults would often reach the Core, but have a Minion wave spawn on them, distract them, and allow them to be killed off before doing any significant damage. With increased range and fixation on a Structure once they’ve started attacking, even one Catapult will more consistently punch through a Core’s Shield and do actual damage.

[*]A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values. [list] Please review our recent [url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095]blog on scaling and respawn timer changes[/url] for more details. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked. This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead. We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios. As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level. Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously. The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game. Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game. It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.  [b]Respawn Timers[/b] [list] [*]Respawn timers have been increased for levels 1 – 10.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] In order to reward players for getting early game Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead, early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries. These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory, without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the opposing enemy team.

We are still heavily evaluating a lot of it but wanted to get the first round of changes in. Internally, we enjoyed the increased importance on Regeneration Globes and have cleaned up the system a bit. With a larger importance, denying enemies their Globes in lane has a much larger impact.

[*]Now: Restore 30% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Much like the changes to Regeneration Globes, we wanted to add a larger impact to the moment you click a Healing Well. Again, we cleaned up the system a fair bit (hence the ~41% to 40% Health change) and added a larger impact for heavy Mana users. The increased cooldown should make the decision of when to tap the Healing Well slightly more interesting.  [b]Minions[/b] [list] [*][b]Ranged, Melee, and Wizard Minions[/b] [list] Now deal an additional 50% damage to Structures. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Our goal with this change is to make escorting Minions to Towns to be more impactful, such that they can really start to do some damage if left unattended. Before this change, Minions were primarily XP carriers that absorbed some Ammo shots from Towers. Now the armies of the Nexus are a bit scarier when they march down a lane.  [list] [*][b]Catapult Minions[/b] [list] Attack range increased by 20%. [*]Sight range increased by 17%. [*]Will now fixate on Structures. Catapults will not acquire a new target after fixating until the target is destroyed or the Catapult is killed. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Catapults would often reach the Core, but have a Minion wave spawn on them, distract them, and allow them to be killed off before doing any significant damage. With increased range and fixation on a Structure once they’ve started attacking, even one Catapult will more consistently punch through a Core’s Shield and do actual damage.

[*]A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values. [list] Please review our recent [url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095]blog on scaling and respawn timer changes[/url] for more details. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked. This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead. We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios. As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level. Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously. The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game. Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game. It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.  [b]Respawn Timers[/b] [list] [*]Respawn timers have been increased for levels 1 – 10.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] In order to reward players for getting early game Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead, early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries. These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory, without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the opposing enemy team.

We are still heavily evaluating a lot of it but wanted to get the first round of changes in. Internally, we enjoyed the increased importance on Regeneration Globes and have cleaned up the system a bit. With a larger importance, denying enemies their Globes in lane has a much larger impact.  [b]Healing Wells[/b] [list] [*]Cooldown increased from 100 to 120 seconds [*][b]Health Regeneration[/b] [list] Previously: Restore 41% of maximum Health over 20 seconds.

[*]Now: Restore 30% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Much like the changes to Regeneration Globes, we wanted to add a larger impact to the moment you click a Healing Well. Again, we cleaned up the system a fair bit (hence the ~41% to 40% Health change) and added a larger impact for heavy Mana users. The increased cooldown should make the decision of when to tap the Healing Well slightly more interesting.  [b]Minions[/b] [list] [*][b]Ranged, Melee, and Wizard Minions[/b] [list] Now deal an additional 50% damage to Structures. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Our goal with this change is to make escorting Minions to Towns to be more impactful, such that they can really start to do some damage if left unattended. Before this change, Minions were primarily XP carriers that absorbed some Ammo shots from Towers. Now the armies of the Nexus are a bit scarier when they march down a lane.  [list] [*][b]Catapult Minions[/b] [list] Attack range increased by 20%. [*]Sight range increased by 17%. [*]Will now fixate on Structures.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Catapults would often reach the Core, but have a Minion wave spawn on them, distract them, and allow them to be killed off before doing any significant damage. With increased range and fixation on a Structure once they’ve started attacking, even one Catapult will more consistently punch through a Core’s Shield and do actual damage.

[*]A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values. [list] Please review our recent [url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095]blog on scaling and respawn timer changes[/url] for more details. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked. This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead. We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios. As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level. Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously. The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game. Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game. It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.  [b]Respawn Timers[/b] [list] [*]Respawn timers have been increased for levels 1 – 10.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] In order to reward players for getting early game Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead, early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries. These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory, without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the opposing enemy team.

[b]Healing Wells[/b] [list] [*]Cooldown increased from 100 to 120 seconds [*][b]Health Regeneration[/b] [list] Previously: Restore 41% of maximum Health over 20 seconds. [*]Now: Restore 40% of maximum Health over 20 seconds. [/list] [*][b]Mana Regeneration[/b] [list] Previously: Restore 20% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds. [*]Now: Restore 30% of maximum Mana over 20 seconds. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Much like the changes to Regeneration Globes, we wanted to add a larger impact to the moment you click a Healing Well. Again, we cleaned up the system a fair bit (hence the ~41% to 40% Health change) and added a larger impact for heavy Mana users. The increased cooldown should make the decision of when to tap the Healing Well slightly more interesting.  [b]Minions[/b] [list] [*][b]Ranged, Melee, and Wizard Minions[/b] [list] Now deal an additional 50% damage to Structures. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Our goal with this change is to make escorting Minions to Towns to be more impactful, such that they can really start to do some damage if left unattended. Before this change, Minions were primarily XP carriers that absorbed some Ammo shots from Towers. Now the armies of the Nexus are a bit scarier when they march down a lane.  [list] [*][b]Catapult Minions[/b] [list] Attack range increased by 20%. [*]Sight range increased by 17%. [*]Will now fixate on Structures. Catapults will not acquire a new target after fixating until the target is destroyed or the Catapult is killed. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Catapults would often reach the Core, but have a Minion wave spawn on them, distract them, and allow them to be killed off before doing any significant damage. With increased range and fixation on a Structure once they’ve started attacking, even one Catapult will more consistently punch through a Core’s Shield and do actual damage.  Bug Fixes [list] [*][b]Tomb of the Spider Queen:[/b] The number of Spider Gems held by each team will now always display, even if zero Gems are currently being carried.

While we’re okay with players doing this to a degree, we found it was too effective given how little counterplay there was. To help solve this, turned a sizable portion of Healing Well Health into a Shield. This means that if you offer your Healing Well some respite from enemy attacks by chasing opponents away every now and then, it will start to regenerate some of that Shield.

[*]A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values. [list] Please review our recent [url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095]blog on scaling and respawn timer changes[/url] for more details. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked. This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead. We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios. As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level. Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously. The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game. Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game. It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.  [b]Respawn Timers[/b] [list] [*]Respawn timers have been increased for levels 1 – 10.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] In order to reward players for getting early game Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead, early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries. These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory, without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the opposing enemy team.  [b]Attack Speed Slows[/b] [list] [*]Attack speed slows now apply only to Heroes and Summons.

[*]A large portion of Heroes’ total scaling amounts, which were previously gained over the course of a game, have been added to their base values. [list] Please review our recent [url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19906095]blog on scaling and respawn timer changes[/url] for more details. [/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Due to the way that our old level scaling system worked, early game level discrepancies created a larger difference in power level than we liked. This often led to situations where a team could be up two or more levels early in a game, and use this advantage to create a larger lead. We didn’t feel that games were fun for the winning or losing team in these types of scenarios. As a result of these changes, all Heroes will have more power early, but gain less from each level. Battleground Events, Minions, Mercenaries, and Structures have all been adjusted to compensate for this and should feel close to what they did previously. The aim of these adjustments to the scaling system is to make level differences have a similar impact on your Hero’s statistics at all points in a game. Now, each level offers about 4% Health and 4% damage, which mirrors what late game leads felt like in our previous version of the game. It is important to note, that while being down a few levels will be less punishing than it was previously, Talent tier advantages can and will still have a noticeable impact on enemy engagements.

[/list] [/list]  [b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] In order to reward players for getting early game Takedowns, we’re also increasing the respawn time of dead Heroes at low levels. Now, getting early game Takedowns (and the experience associated with it) won’t give your team as much pure power as it did previously. Instead, early kills will offer a “power play” moment, in which your team can destroy enemy Structures, complete Battleground Events, or take more Mercenaries. These meaningful strategic advantages will position a team closer to victory, without giving them a large stat advantage and the ability to bully the opposing enemy team.
