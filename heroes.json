However, Misha and Samuro's Images exceptionally do expire.There are some limitations and exceptions to cloning certain Heroes:- Deathwing cannot be cloned due to his Trait.- Cloning Cho'gall only grants access to Cho's Abilities.- Cloning a Viking only clones the specific Viking targeted, but it gains access to all Basic Abilities the Vikings have unlocked through Talents in that game.- D.Va's clone can only use the form she was cloned from. Pilot D.Va's Call Mech is disabled, and activating Self-Destruct in Mech mode immediately returns control to Abathur, leaving the exploding Mech on the Battleground. Additionally, if Ultimate Evolution expires during this time, the Mech will instantly explode as it does.- Kharazim's level 1 Talent is inherited, as it is his Trait.- Murky's Trait, Spawn Egg, is disabled.- Alexstrasza's and Ragnaros's Traits start on full cooldown every time they are copied, making it impossible to use Molten Core and Dragonqueen during the clone's lifetime.- The effects of Jaina's Frostbite, Malthael's Reaper's Mark, Murky's Slime, Stukov's Healing Pathogen and Weighted Pustule, Sylvanas's Banshee's Curse, Tassadar's Psionic Storm, and Zagara's Creep Tumor do not stack and are instead shared, benefitting both the clone and the cloned Hero regardless of who applied the effect.- Qhira's Blood Rage can stack up to 10 times if a Clone of her is active - if both have at least one Bleed stack on the same target, then they both get a number of stacks equal to double the sum of their real stacks placed on the target (capped at 10). However, only the unit who placed the first Bleed stack on the unit may activate Blood Rage on it. Additionally, after the Clone expires, the Bleed stacks do not, and both Qhira and Abathur may maintain and extend each other's Bleed stacks while at least one of them has a Bleed stack on the target.- Stukov's or his Clone's Bio-Kill Switch detonates all Viruses placed by either. However, only the units that have received a Virus from that specific Stukov can be affected by their Bio-Kill Switch.- Both Probius and his Ultimate Evolution Clone can fully interact with each other's Pylons and Warp Rifts.The Clone grants no XP or Takedown credit on death.The Clone's Summons do not benefit from this Ability's Spell Power bonus.Attack Damage and Spell Power bonuses stack additively with offensive damage modifiers and healing dealt modifiers.","key":"R","icon":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D"},{"name":"Evolve Monstrosity","cost":"","cooldown":"90 seconds","description":"Turn an allied Minion or Locust into a Monstrosity.
