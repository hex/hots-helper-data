They get assigned HigherHealth (HH) and LowerHealth (LH). Now their current health is \"saved\", and a new health is now assigned. HH new health is LH's current health percent, while LH new health is HH current (note these are variables, no damage is done yet). Now two new variables are set, SwapDamage, which is HHcurrent-HHnew and SwapHeal, which is LHnew-LHcurrent, this is done to change from percent to a flat ammount. A DoT of SwapDamage strength is made for HH, and SwapHeal HoT for LH. A visual effect is created then if HH is the casting unit (to add insult to injury).The HoT/DoT ticks 6 times over 3 seconds. Once every 0.5 seconds.Since both the DoT and HoT are flat ammounts, this means that they're both affected by anything that affects those effects. Armor reduces the damage, it can be dispelled by effects like Valeera's Cloak of Shadows, and you can multiply the heal by effects such as Valeera's Wound Poison. If the DoT is removed, you'll still get healed.
