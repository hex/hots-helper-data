As a result, we are reducing the duration of many of these effects in\n  the game.

At 70\n  seconds we think this talent is still a great level 20 pick, but now players\n  will have to be more strategic with how they use it. Forcing someone to use\n  their Bolt to avoid a gank can now be a meaningful moment with this increased\n  cooldown. We hope this also entices players towards choosing their Heroic\n  upgrades instead of Bolt when the situation calls for it.\n\n\n\nCooldown increased from 40 to 70 seconds\n\n\n              Imposing Presence\n\n\n  Developer Comments: Statistically, it was almost never wrong to choose\n  Imposing Presence. With this nerf, it’s still a great counter in the right\n  situation, and as a result, we’re hoping we’ll see more play from our Basic\n  Attack assassins.\n\n\n\nAttack Speed slow reduced from 50% to 40%\nThe Attack Speed slow will now be removed when attacking a target that has not learned the Imposing Presence Talent\n\n\n              Mercenary Lord\n\n\n  Developer Comments: We’ve combined the talent Superiority into\n  Mercenary Lord, and removed the damage reduction from structures to prevent\n  degenerative backdoor strategies. The combination of the damage reduction vs.\n  Mercenaries and the ability to empower these Mercenaries felt like a logical\n  pairing. We hope incorporating the two talents into one will make this level 4\n  choice an enticing one, as the two talents separated had a low pick rate.\n\n\n\nThe functionality of the Superiority Talent has been rolled into Mercenary Lord, which is now available to the following Heroes at Level 4:\n\nAnub'arak, Arthas, Azmodan, Gazlowe, Nazeebo, Sonya, Stitches, and The Lost Vikings\n\nNew combined functionality reads: Non-Boss Mercenaries near your Hero deal 50% more damage.

We\n  think this build is a ton of fun, so we didn’t want to negatively impact this\n  build. Instead, we wanted to give Azmodan some other build options. Right now,\n  it’s almost always a mistake to summon one of his Demons and waste your mana.\n  With the new tuning, and the talent changes, the Demons become a legitimate\n  option to use. The Demons start with much more damage than previously, but\n  scale close to what they use to be at higher levels. For players who still\n  plan to go the (Q) build, it’s mostly the same, but we’ve offered a few\n  additional talent choices to make options that best fit your play style.\n  Finally, we are removing some of the Support nature of Healing Ward and Storm\n  Shield from Azmodan.

We wanted to increase the cooldown reduction granted by the Talent,\n  but didn’t want Heroic Ability cooldowns to drop to absurdly low levels. By\n  making it only reduce the cooldowns of Basic Abilities (Q, W, E), it allowed\n  us to increase this cooldown reduction without making it overpowered. We’ve\n  also made Battle Momentum Hero-specific, so that we can tune each one without\n  affecting all the rest, since Attack Speed, melee versus range, and the nature\n  of your Basic Abilities can all drastically change what is balanced.\n\n\n              Hero Updates\n              \nShadow Charge (Q)\n\nThe implementation for this Ability has been reworked.\n\nNo longer automatically Stuns the target at the end of the knockback phase, and instead applies a Daze for the duration of the knockback.\nTargets that collide with terrain will still be stunned for 1 second.\nDiablo will now continue travelling toward the enemy target for the duration of the knockback phase.\n\n\nApocalypse (R)\n\nStun duration reduced from 2 to 1.75 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n  Developer Comments: Shadow Charge seems like a really simple Ability,\n  but on the backend there were a lot of technical manipulations to make\n  everything work the way they were intended. These were starting to create odd\n  gameplay and bugs, so we’ve simplified the design of the Ability so that\n  Diablo travels right alongside his victim as they are knocked back, instead of\n  walking really fast toward them. \n  \n  Additionally, we’ve received a lot of feedback from players\n  regarding the popular strategy of chaining movement impairing effects, like\n  Stuns and Roots, on an enemy Hero. While we want this to be a viable way to\n  play, we feel it’s currently too prominent and powerful at higher levels of\n  play. As a result, we are reducing the duration of many of these effects in\n  the game. In scenarios where this change nerfs a character we don’t otherwise\n  want to nerf, we’re coupling it with a buff to help offset the difference.\n  While this change hasn’t reduced all effects that might make you lose control\n  of your Hero, we feel these are some of the more egregious ones.

That said, we do feel that Gilnean Cocktail should be more\n  satisfying when used correctly. We’re increasing the cooldown in order to\n  justify also increasing the damage of the explosion so that it is very\n  noticeable when you chunk enemies with the Ability. We’ve also tuned up\n  Incendiary Elixir, while simplifying its design. We’ve increased the damage\n  bonus of Worgen form so that closing into melee range is more often worth the\n  risk as well.\n\n\n            "},{"name":"2016-05-17 Patch Notes ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20120032/heroes-of-the-storm-patch-notes-may-17-2016","content":"\n              Talents\n              Executioner\n\n\nThis Talent has been reworked.\n\nIncreases Basic Attack damage by 30% for 3 seconds after hitting a Stunned, Slowed, or Rooted target with a Basic Attack.

His new Talent tree puts damage, survivability,\n  and utility options within their own tiers, and allows you to customize how\n  you want to do those things based upon your opponents and your preferred\n  playstyle.  \n  \n  We also wanted to really embrace the skill cap required to play Illidan while\n  not making him too difficult to pick up and learn. Some of his Talents are now\n  harder to pull off, but offer much higher bonuses if you’re able to use them\n  effectively. If those aren’t for you, then you can always pick the Talents\n  that are more consistent and easier to use.  \n  \n  Finally, we buffed Illidan’s base kit to make up for losing some of the\n  Talents that he was previously relying on. Overall, we think Illidan is now a\n  lot more fun to play, and that you won’t know exactly what your Talent build\n  will be until you’re in a game.\n\n\nIllidan Talents\n\n\n\n\n  Level (Tier)\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n  1 (1)\n  Immolation (W)\n  Battered Assault (W)\n  Unending Hatred\n  —\n\n\n  4 (2)\n  Rapid Chase (Q)\n  Friend or Foe (Q)\n  Unbound (W)\n  —\n\n\n  7 (3)\n  Reflexive Block (Q)\n  Thirsting Blade (Trait)\n  Hunter's Onslaught (Trait)\n  —\n\n\n  10 (4)\n  Metamorphosis (R)\n  The Hunt (R)\n  —\n  —\n\n\n  13 (5)\n  Nimble Defender (W)\n  Elusive Strike (E)\n  Sixth Sense (E)\n  —\n\n\n  16 (6)\n  Marked for Death (Q)\n  Fiery Brand\n  Blades of Azzinoth (W)\n  —\n\n\n  20 (7)\n  Demonic Form (R)\n  Nowhere to Hide (R)\n  Nexus Blades\n  Bolt of the Storm\n\n\n\n\n\nItalics indicates a NEW Talent\nBold indicates a MOVED Talent\n\n\n            "},{"name":"2016-02-02 Patch Notes ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19995509/heroes-of-the-storm-patch-notes-february-2-2016","content":"\n              Design & Gameplay\n              Battleground Monsters\n\n\nBattleground-specific creatures are now universally defined as Monsters (ex: Neutral Garden Terrors, Sky Temple Guardians, etc.)\nSeveral Talents and Abilities have been changed to reflect this new categorization, and the following no longer affect Monsters:\n\nMercenary Lord\nJohanna's Knight Takes Pawn\nLunara's Cruel Bloom\nRexxar's Easy Prey and Bird of Prey\nThe Butcher's Chop Meat\n\nThe following now affect Monsters:\n\nAnub'arak's Beetle, Juiced\nAzmodan's Demonic Smite\n\nSeveral Talents that could previously trigger against both captured Mercenaries and Minions will now only affect Minions (ex: Seasoned Marksman, Black Soulstone, etc.)\n\n\n              Hero Updates\n              \nBasic Attack damage increased from 74 (+4% per level) to 78(+4% per level)\n\n\n            "},{"name":"2015-10-06 Patch Notes ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19893628/heroes-of-the-storm-patch-notes-october-6-2015","content":"\n              Design & Gameplay\n              Vehicles and Regeneration Globe Interaction\n\n\nRegeneration Globes will no longer heal Dragon Knights and Garden Terrors.\n\nInstead, Regeneration Globe effects will now be applied directly to the Hero inside the Dragon Knight or Garden Terror.\n\nPlayers within a Dragon Knight or Garden Terror can now also accumulate stacks for Talents such as Seasoned Marksman, Gathering Power, Regeneration Master, etc.\n\n\n              Bug Fixes\n              \nIllidan's Sweeping Strike will now properly deal damage when the Immolation Talent damages the target at the same moment.\n\n\n            "},{"name":"2015-08-18 Patch Notes ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19818499/heroes-of-the-storm-patch-notes-august-18-2015","content":"\n              Design & Gameplay\n              Bonus Effects from Kills\n\n\n  Developer Comments: This change will not have a major impact on\n  today’s gameplay and was mostly done for consistency on how these type of\n  talents worked.

This occurred if players kept a summon alive for a\n  very long time and gained Ability Power via Talents, like Gathering Power, as\n  this increase in Ability Power was not passed onto the Summon.

This occurred if players kept a summon alive for a\n  very long time and gained Ability Power via Talents, like Gathering Power, as\n  this increase in Ability Power was not passed onto the Summon. Short term\n  summons or persistent effects will still take a snapshot of your current\n  Ability Power at the time they are cast, and apply the bonus for the complete\n  duration of the effect.\n\n\n\nTo clarify the rules for temporary Ability Power gains, the following rules have been added:\n\nFor permanent or very long duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health will now update dynamically when Ability Power is modified. This includes:\n\nAbathur's Monstrosity\nNazeebo's Gargantuan (with the Humongoid Talent)\n\nFor short duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health should snapshot based upon the Ability Power of the character when they are cast. This includes:\n\nJaina's Water Elemental\nSgt. Hammer's Blunt Force Gun\nTychus' Drakken Laser Drill\n\n\n\n\n              Talents\n              Bolt of the Storm\n\n\n  Developer Comments: We love this talent and think it can create a lot\n  of really interesting moments, but the cooldown was just too short. At 70\n  seconds we think this talent is still a great level 20 pick, but now players\n  will have to be more strategic with how they use it. Forcing someone to use\n  their Bolt to avoid a gank can now be a meaningful moment with this increased\n  cooldown. We hope this also entices players towards choosing their Heroic\n  upgrades instead of Bolt when the situation calls for it.\n\n\n\nCooldown increased from 40 to 70 seconds\n\n\n              Gathering Power\n\n\n  Developer Comments: Gathering Power was simply too good and was\n  considered, by many, a mandatory pick on certain characters, which often lead\n  to snowballing. We liked the ‘quest’ aspect of this talent, but it was far too\n  easy to reach the cap and the quest didn’t feel meaningful to complete. Now,\n  choosing this talent should no longer be mandatory, and the quest is much\n  longer. Player’s will keep half of their stacks upon dying, which will help\n  act as a ‘check point’.\n\n\n\nThe 5% starting Ability Power has been removed\nPercentage gain from killing a Hero reduced from 2% to 1%\nInstead of losing all stacks on death, players will now only lose half their stacks (rounding up)\n\n\n              Mercenary Lord\n\n\n  Developer Comments: We’ve combined the talent Superiority into\n  Mercenary Lord, and removed the damage reduction from structures to prevent\n  degenerative backdoor strategies. The combination of the damage reduction vs.\n  Mercenaries and the ability to empower these Mercenaries felt like a logical\n  pairing. We hope incorporating the two talents into one will make this level 4\n  choice an enticing one, as the two talents separated had a low pick rate.\n\n\n\nThe functionality of the Superiority Talent has been rolled into Mercenary Lord, which is now available to the following Heroes at Level 4:\n\nAnub'arak, Arthas, Azmodan, Gazlowe, Nazeebo, Sonya, Stitches, and The Lost Vikings\n\nNew combined functionality reads: Non-Boss Mercenaries near your Hero deal 50% more damage. Reduces damage taken from Minions and Mercenaries by 50%.\n\n\n              Superiority\n\n\nThis Talent has been removed, and its functionality has been rolled into the revamped Mercenary Lord Talent\n\n\n              Hero Updates\n              \n  Developer Comments: We looked at tuning up talents that wouldn’t\n  impact his core Spider build.

Increasing his\n  trait damage from 1.5% to 2.0% will make sure he shreds those high health\n  warriors even further, while the health increase will let him turret on his\n  target longer and trade better.\n\n\n            "},{"name":"2016-03-29 Patch Notes ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20063493/heroes-of-the-storm-patch-notes-march-29-2016","content":"\n              Hero Updates\n              \nThis Hero has received significant Talent changes\nHealth increased from 1545 (+4% per level) to 1669 (+4% per level)\nHealth Regeneration increased from approximately 3.22 to 3.48 Health per second\nRegeneration Master (Talent) removed\nScouting Drone (Talent) removed\nFocused Attack (Talent) removed\nVampiric Assault (Talent) removed\nFirst Aid (Talent) removed\nSizzlin’ Attacks (Talent) removed\nProblem Solver (Talent) removed\nExecutioner (Talent) removed\nStoneskin (Talent) removed\nNexus Frenzy (Talent) removed\nBolt of the Storm (Talent) removed\nRelentless (Talent) renamed Relentless Soldier and moved from Level 13 to Level 7\n\nDuration reduction for silences, stuns, slows, and roots decreased from 50% to 33%\n\nNew Talent (Level 4): Master Assassin\n\nHero takedowns increase Attack Speed by 2%, up to a maximum of 20%\nWhile at maximum stacks, Tychus gains an additional 10% Attack Speed bonus\n\nNew Talent (Level 13): Neosteel Coating\n\nActivate to reduce incoming Ability damage by 50% for 3 seconds. 30 second cooldown\n\nNew Talent (Level 20): Sizzlin’ Attacks\n\nBasic Attacks deal 1% of the target’s maximum Health as damage\n\nMinigun (Trait) (D)\n\nMinigun has been redesigned\n\nNo longer requires wind-up\nActivate to cause Basic Attacks against Heroes to deal bonus damage equal to 1.5% of the target’s maximum Health.

This occurred if players kept a summon alive for a\n  very long time and gained Ability Power via Talents, like Gathering Power, as\n  this increase in Ability Power was not passed onto the Summon. Short term\n  summons or persistent effects will still take a snapshot of your current\n  Ability Power at the time they are cast, and apply the bonus for the complete\n  duration of the effect.\n\n\n\nTo clarify the rules for temporary Ability Power gains, the following rules have been added:\n\nFor permanent or very long duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health will now update dynamically when Ability Power is modified. This includes:\n\nAbathur's Monstrosity\nNazeebo's Gargantuan (with the Humongoid Talent)\n\nFor short duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health should snapshot based upon the Ability Power of the character when they are cast.

At 70\n  seconds we think this talent is still a great level 20 pick, but now players\n  will have to be more strategic with how they use it. Forcing someone to use\n  their Bolt to avoid a gank can now be a meaningful moment with this increased\n  cooldown. We hope this also entices players towards choosing their Heroic\n  upgrades instead of Bolt when the situation calls for it.\n\n\n\nCooldown increased from 40 to 70 seconds\n\n\n              Focused Attacks\n\n\n  Developer Comments: This could be viewed as a buff or nerf depending\n  on how players perceive it. You can still reduce the cooldown by attacking\n  Minions, but won’t accidently waste a burst of damage on an unintended target.\n  This talent will no longer be as effective at sieging, but it should be\n  significantly better at harassing in lane.

Our main goal was to increase the potential for amazing Valla\n  players to differentiate themselves from the mediocre ones and aimed the\n  majority of these changes toward lifting her skill-ceiling. We believe that\n  players will still be able to build Valla very similarly to the ways they have\n  in the past, but with more interesting and potentially powerful payoffs.

This occurred if players kept a summon alive for a\n  very long time and gained Ability Power via Talents, like Gathering Power, as\n  this increase in Ability Power was not passed onto the Summon. Short term\n  summons or persistent effects will still take a snapshot of your current\n  Ability Power at the time they are cast, and apply the bonus for the complete\n  duration of the effect.\n\n\n\nTo clarify the rules for temporary Ability Power gains, the following rules have been added:\n\nFor permanent or very long duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health will now update dynamically when Ability Power is modified. This includes:\n\nAbathur's Monstrosity\nNazeebo's Gargantuan (with the Humongoid Talent)\n\nFor short duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health should snapshot based upon the Ability Power of the character when they are cast.

Hammer's Blunt Force Gun\nTychus' Drakken Laser Drill\n\n\n\n\n              Bonus Effects from Kills\n\n\n  Developer Comments: This change will not have a major impact on\n  today’s gameplay and was mostly done for consistency on how these type of\n  talents worked. In the future, it may allow us to develop Battlegrounds with\n  many small minions (think Haunted Mines) and not have to worry about special\n  casing Seasoned Marksman so it doesn’t get out of control.\n\n\n\nTalents and Abilities that gain bonus effects from kills will now only trigger from Minions and Mercenaries, and will no longer gain benefit from killing neutral Mercenaries, map event creatures, summoned units, etc.\n\n\n              Talents\n              Focused Attacks\n\n\n  Developer Comments: This could be viewed as a buff or nerf depending\n  on how players perceive it. You can still reduce the cooldown by attacking\n  Minions, but won’t accidently waste a burst of damage on an unintended target.\n  This talent will no longer be as effective at sieging, but it should be\n  significantly better at harassing in lane. We will continue to monitor the\n  talent, and tune as necessary.\n\n\n\nThe increased damage effect will now only trigger when hitting Heroes\n\n\n              Gathering Power\n\n\n  Developer Comments: Gathering Power was simply too good and was\n  considered, by many, a mandatory pick on certain characters, which often lead\n  to snowballing. We liked the ‘quest’ aspect of this talent, but it was far too\n  easy to reach the cap and the quest didn’t feel meaningful to complete.

While we\n  don’t want to give Malfurion a solid burst healing option, we agreed and have\n  tuned this talent up to 50%. At 50%, and in a vacuum, this talent may still be\n  undertuned, but it eventually adds up to a decent additional amount of\n  healing.

When we sat down to talk about what we wanted to do for\n  her, we quickly realized that a slight Talent shuffle was not going to be\n  possible. We wanted to keep her playstyle as similar to live as possible while\n  also addressing some of our core concerns with her, which were:\n  \n  \n  She can be very frustrating to play against for newer players.\n  She isn’t viable in competitive play.\n  Her Talent pick rates were not great.\n  \n  \n  This new direction for Nova addresses the first two issues by lowering her\n  overall burst potential, while increasing her damage output overall. The most\n  noticeable way we did this was through lowering both her Snipe cooldown and\n  damage. For the third concern, we decided to do an overarching sweep of her\n  Talents, removing the ones that weren’t working, and created some new ones\n  that should offer interesting choices that promote Nova’s roaming and ganking\n  nature. We realize that this is a slight departure from her long history of\n  burst damage, but feel it is a better direction for her in the long run. We\n  are watching her very carefully in order to react quickly and tune\n  accordingly.\n\n\n              Bug Fixes\n              \nMurky’s Egg will no longer briefly display on the minimap if he is killed by Nova’s Pinning Shot.\n\n\n              \nNova’s Crippling Shot Talent will no longer allow Holo Decoys’ Pinning Shots to make the target Vulnerable without the Lethal Decoy Talent.\n\n\n            "},{"name":"2015-11-17 Patch Notes ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19960704/heroes-of-the-storm-patch-notes-november-17-2015","content":"\n              Talents\n              Gathering Power\n\n\nHero takedowns now increase Ability Power by 2% per kill, up to a maximum of 30%.

This occurred if players kept a summon alive for a\n  very long time and gained Ability Power via Talents, like Gathering Power, as\n  this increase in Ability Power was not passed onto the Summon. Short term\n  summons or persistent effects will still take a snapshot of your current\n  Ability Power at the time they are cast, and apply the bonus for the complete\n  duration of the effect.\n\n\n\nTo clarify the rules for temporary Ability Power gains, the following rules have been added:\n\nFor permanent or very long duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health will now update dynamically when Ability Power is modified. This includes:\n\nAbathur's Monstrosity\nNazeebo's Gargantuan (with the Humongoid Talent)\n\nFor short duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health should snapshot based upon the Ability Power of the character when they are cast.

At 70\n  seconds we think this talent is still a great level 20 pick, but now players\n  will have to be more strategic with how they use it. Forcing someone to use\n  their Bolt to avoid a gank can now be a meaningful moment with this increased\n  cooldown. We hope this also entices players towards choosing their Heroic\n  upgrades instead of Bolt when the situation calls for it.\n\n\n\nCooldown increased from 40 to 70 seconds\n\n\n              Gathering Power\n\n\n  Developer Comments: Gathering Power was simply too good and was\n  considered, by many, a mandatory pick on certain characters, which often lead\n  to snowballing. We liked the ‘quest’ aspect of this talent, but it was far too\n  easy to reach the cap and the quest didn’t feel meaningful to complete. Now,\n  choosing this talent should no longer be mandatory, and the quest is much\n  longer. Player’s will keep half of their stacks upon dying, which will help\n  act as a ‘check point’.\n\n\n\nThe 5% starting Ability Power has been removed\nPercentage gain from killing a Hero reduced from 2% to 1%\nInstead of losing all stacks on death, players will now only lose half their stacks (rounding up)\n\n\n              Bug Fixes\n              \nFixed an issue in which the following Abilities and Talents were not damaging or destroying Zagara's Creep Tumors:\n\nBrightwing's Peekaboo, Diablo's Firestorm (returning fireballs), Johanna's Blessed Hammer, Leoric's Buried Alive, Nova's Railgun, Sgt.

Here’s a\n  very brief explanation:\n  \n  \n  Rehgar was usually brought to teams as a main support, which meant\n  players were heavily incentivized to pick every healing option available to\n  him. We tried to rectify this by placing healing Talents against each other on\n  the same Talent tier. Of course, this removes some of his healing power as\n  players cannot stack each Talent, so we also increased his base power to\n  compensate. Our hope is that these changes will allow Rehgar players to be a\n  more aggressive while supporting their team, which was always his design\n  intent.\n  \n\n\n            "},{"name":"2016-01-27 Balance Update ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20021838/heroes-of-the-storm-balance-update-notes-january-27-2016","content":"\n              Talents\n              Cleanse\n\n\nTooltip updated to reflect that Cleanse cannot be self-cast\n\n\n            "},{"name":"2016-01-20 Balance Update ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19996517/heroes-of-the-storm-balance-update-notes-january-20-2016","content":"\n              Talents\n              Cleanse\n\n\nThis Talent’s functionality has changed significantly\nTarget ally now becomes Unstoppable for 1 second.

This occurred if players kept a summon alive for a\n  very long time and gained Ability Power via Talents, like Gathering Power, as\n  this increase in Ability Power was not passed onto the Summon. Short term\n  summons or persistent effects will still take a snapshot of your current\n  Ability Power at the time they are cast, and apply the bonus for the complete\n  duration of the effect.\n\n\n\nTo clarify the rules for temporary Ability Power gains, the following rules have been added:\n\nFor permanent or very long duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health will now update dynamically when Ability Power is modified. This includes:\n\nAbathur's Monstrosity\nNazeebo's Gargantuan (with the Humongoid Talent)\n\nFor short duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health should snapshot based upon the Ability Power of the character when they are cast.

In the future, it may allow us to develop Battlegrounds with\n  many small minions (think Haunted Mines) and not have to worry about special\n  casing Seasoned Marksman so it doesn’t get out of control.\n\n\n\nTalents and Abilities that gain bonus effects from kills will now only trigger from Minions and Mercenaries, and will no longer gain benefit from killing neutral Mercenaries, map event creatures, summoned units, etc.\n\n\n              Talents\n              Gathering Power\n\n\n  Developer Comments: Gathering Power was simply too good and was\n  considered, by many, a mandatory pick on certain characters, which often lead\n  to snowballing. We liked the ‘quest’ aspect of this talent, but it was far too\n  easy to reach the cap and the quest didn’t feel meaningful to complete. Now,\n  choosing this talent should no longer be mandatory, and the quest is much\n  longer.

Ideally, this will become a great talent pick when facing\n  The Lost Vikings or Murky players.\n\n\n\nStacks earned by killing enemy Heroes increased from 2 to 3\nOnly Minions, captured enemy Mercenaries, and Heroes will grant stacks upon death\n\n\n              Hero Updates\n              \n  Developer Comments: Mighty Gust can be a great disengagement tool, but\n  it is often outshined by the pure power of Hinterland Blast.

While its win rate was in line with other talents, its pick\n  rate was dominating the tier, and we weren’t happy with how much it let Tracer\n  use her Recall as a \"get out of jail free card\" due to the guaranteed blinks\n  that she would always have afterwards. Now she can still have the same moment\n  of power, but she will have to get in and get the kill in order to Recall out\n  to safety.  \n  \n  Total Recall is a great fantasy hit for us, but it comes at the cost of giving\n  Tracer something that she really wants in the form of self-sustain.

We’re going to be giving back some of that Basic Attack damage on\n  her Level 16 Talent tier to further separate Sleight of Hand from the other\n  options, which should help the choice between more Pulse Bomb charges vs.\n  stronger Basic Attacks feel like a more meaningful decision.  \n  \n  We also saw an opportunity to help improve her Talent pick rates, so we’re\n  making minor adjustments to Pulse Strike and Slipstream.  \n  \n  We’ll continue to keep a close eye on her, as we believe she is similar to\n  Illidan, where the right place from a balance perspective is more narrow than\n  most of our other Heroes.\n\n\n            "},{"name":"2016-04-27 Balance Update ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20102776/heroes-of-the-storm-balance-update-notes-april-27-2016","content":"\n              Bug Fixes\n              \nMurky’s Egg location will no longer be revealed if he is killed by Tracer’s Melee Ability.\n\n\n              \nRegeneration Globes will no longer grant 200% Health Regeneration to Tracer after learning her Untouchable Talent.\n\n\n            "},{"name":"2016-04-19 Patch Notes ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20099322/heroes-of-the-storm-patch-notes-april-19-2016","content":"\n              New Hero\n              \nTracer has been added to Heroes of the Storm and is now available for play!\n\n\n            "}],"Tyrande":[{"name":"2016-09-13 Patch Notes ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20243513/heroes-of-the-storm-patch-notes-september-13-2016","content":"\n              Bug Fixes\n              \nCalldown: MULE: Will now properly acquire a new repair target if the Structure it is actively repairing is destroyed.\n\n\n            "},{"name":"2016-07-12 Patch Notes ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20164442/heroes-of-the-storm-patch-notes-july-12-2016","content":"\n              Bug Fixes\n              \nTyrande: Picking the Celestial Wrath Talent will no longer prevent Starfall’s cooldown timer from displaying appropriately on the in-game Score Screen’s Talent pane.\n\n\n            "},{"name":"2016-05-17 Patch Notes ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20120032/heroes-of-the-storm-patch-notes-may-17-2016","content":"\n              Talents\n              Battle Momentum\n\n\nBattle Momentum has been made Hero-specific, and now only applies to Basic Ability cooldowns.\nDiablo\n\nDiabolical Momentum\n\nBasic Attacks now reduce Basic Ability cooldowns by 0.75 seconds instead of 0.5.\nNo longer reduces Heroic Ability cooldowns.\n\n\nJohanna\n\nBlessed Momentum\n\nNo longer reduces Heroic Ability cooldowns.\n\n\nKerrigan\n\nBladed Momentum\n\nBasic Attacks now reduce Basic Ability cooldowns by 0.75 seconds instead of 0.5.\nNo longer reduces Heroic Ability cooldowns.\n\n\nTyrael\n\nAngelic Momentum\n\nBasic Attacks now reduce Basic Ability cooldowns by 0.75 seconds instead of 0.5.\nNo longer reduces Heroic Ability cooldowns.\n\n\nTyrande\n\nLunar Momentum\n\nBasic Attacks now reduce Basic Ability cooldowns by 0.6 seconds instead of 0.5.\nNo longer reduces Heroic Ability cooldowns.\n\n\nZagara\n\nSwarm Momentum\n\nBasic Attacks now reduce Basic Ability cooldowns by 0.75 seconds instead of 0.5.\nNo longer reduces Heroic Ability or Trait cooldowns.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Developer Comments: Our intention for Battle Momentum was to create\n  more active gameplay by using your Basic Abilities more often, but we found\n  that a lot of this Talent’s power lied in its ability to reduce your Heroic\n  cooldowns. We wanted to increase the cooldown reduction granted by the Talent,\n  but didn’t want Heroic Ability cooldowns to drop to absurdly low levels. By\n  making it only reduce the cooldowns of Basic Abilities (Q, W, E), it allowed\n  us to increase this cooldown reduction without making it overpowered. We’ve\n  also made Battle Momentum Hero-specific, so that we can tune each one without\n  affecting all the rest, since Attack Speed, melee versus range, and the nature\n  of your Basic Abilities can all drastically change what is balanced.\n\n\n              Seasoned Marksman\n\n\nA reward has been added to this Questing Talent.\n\nQuest: Increases Attack Damage by 0.2 for each enemy Minion killed nearby, and 0.5 for each Hero Takedown, up to a maximum of 40.\nReward: After gaining 40 bonus Attack Damage, Seasoned Marksman can be activated to increase Attack Speed by 30% for 3 seconds. 60 second cooldown. \n\n\n\n\n  Developer Comments: We’ve added a completion point to this Talent.\n  Upon completing its quest, players will be provided with some additional\n  power.

Now, simply picking the Talent and only\n  partially completing it is worse, but finishing the quest will return a larger\n  reward.

He no longer has access to Bolt of the Storm, and Arcane\n  Barrier’s Shield amount has been lowered and tied to a quest on Mana Addict.\n  While Kael’thas can dish out a ton of damage in teamfights, he should be a\n  much more viable target for enemy teams to focus down.\n\n\nKael'thas Talents\n\n\n\n\n  Level (Tier)\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n  1 (1)\n  Convection (Q)\n  Fel Infusion (Trait)\n  Mana Addict\n  —\n\n\n  4 (2)\n  Nether Wind (E)\n  Energy Roil (E)\n  Mana Tap (Trait)\n  —\n\n\n  7 (3)\n  Burned Flesh (Q)\n  Gravity Crush (E)\n  Sunfire Enchantment (Trait)\n  —\n\n\n  10 (4)\n  Phoenix (R)\n  Pyroblast (R)\n  —\n  —\n\n\n  13 (5)\n  Pyromaniac (W)\n  Backdraft (W)\n  Fission Bomb (W)\n  —\n\n\n  16 (6)\n  Fury of the Sunwell (Q)\n  Sun King’s Fury (W)\n  Twin Spheres (Trait)\n  —\n\n\n  20 (7)\n  Rebirth (R)\n  Presence of Mind (R)\n  Master of Flames (W)\n  Arcane Power\n\n\n\n\n\nItalics indicates a NEW Talent\nBold indicates a MOVED Talent\n\n\n            "},{"name":"2016-02-10 Balance Update ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20008204/heroes-of-the-storm-balance-update-notes-february-10-2016","content":"\n              Hero Updates\n              \nBasic Attack damage reduced from 87 (+4% per level) to 65 (+4% per level)\nArcane Barrier (Talent)\n\nShield amount decreased from 200% to 150%\nDuration reduced from 6 to 4 seconds\n\nGravity Lapse (E)\n\nStun duration reduced from 1.5 to 1.0 seconds\n\nPhoenix (R)\n\nCooldown increased from 40 to 60 seconds\n\nPyroblast (R)\n\nDamage increased from 730 (+4% per level) to 810 (+5% per level)\nCooldown increased from 50 to 100 seconds\nPresence of Mind (Talent) \n\nCooldown reduction for Pyroblast increased from 10 to 25 seconds per enemy hero hit\n\n\n\n\n\n  Developer Comments: Kael’thas is a powerful hero with too few\n  downsides.

By nerfing its cooldown, while also pushing\n  Pyroblast to create more impactful moments, we expect there will be more\n  situations where Pyroblast is the optimal pick.\n\n\n            "},{"name":"2015-11-17 Patch Notes ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19960704/heroes-of-the-storm-patch-notes-november-17-2015","content":"\n              Talents\n              Gathering Power\n\n\nHero takedowns now increase Ability Power by 2% per kill, up to a maximum of 30%.

Now, with a much\n  higher cap, the reward for this talent is much higher.

This occurred if players kept a summon alive for a\n  very long time and gained Ability Power via Talents, like Gathering Power, as\n  this increase in Ability Power was not passed onto the Summon. Short term\n  summons or persistent effects will still take a snapshot of your current\n  Ability Power at the time they are cast, and apply the bonus for the complete\n  duration of the effect.\n\n\n\nTo clarify the rules for temporary Ability Power gains, the following rules have been added:\n\nFor permanent or very long duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health will now update dynamically when Ability Power is modified. This includes:\n\nAbathur's Monstrosity\nNazeebo's Gargantuan (with the Humongoid Talent)\n\nFor short duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health should snapshot based upon the Ability Power of the character when they are cast. This includes:\n\nJaina's Water Elemental\nSgt. Hammer's Blunt Force Gun\nTychus' Drakken Laser Drill\n\n\n\n\n              Talents\n              Bolt of the Storm\n\n\n  Developer Comments: We love this talent and think it can create a lot\n  of really interesting moments, but the cooldown was just too short. At 70\n  seconds we think this talent is still a great level 20 pick, but now players\n  will have to be more strategic with how they use it. Forcing someone to use\n  their Bolt to avoid a gank can now be a meaningful moment with this increased\n  cooldown. We hope this also entices players towards choosing their Heroic\n  upgrades instead of Bolt when the situation calls for it.\n\n\n\nCooldown increased from 40 to 70 seconds\n\n\n              Gathering Power\n\n\n  Developer Comments: Gathering Power was simply too good and was\n  considered, by many, a mandatory pick on certain characters, which often lead\n  to snowballing. We liked the ‘quest’ aspect of this talent, but it was far too\n  easy to reach the cap and the quest didn’t feel meaningful to complete. Now,\n  choosing this talent should no longer be mandatory, and the quest is much\n  longer. Player’s will keep half of their stacks upon dying, which will help\n  act as a ‘check point’.\n\n\n\nThe 5% starting Ability Power has been removed\nPercentage gain from killing a Hero reduced from 2% to 1%\nInstead of losing all stacks on death, players will now only lose half their stacks (rounding up)\n\n\n              Hero Updates\n              \n  Developer Comments: Prior to these changes, Kael’Thas had a high win\n  rate, but his win rate wasn’t alarming. Instead, we’re focusing on Kael’thas’\n  current gameplay, as it feels very set in stone and we’d like players to have\n  the option to be creative.
