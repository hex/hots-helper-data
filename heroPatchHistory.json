[/list] \n[b][b]Developer Comment:[/b][/b] Li Li is one of our oldest Heroes and has remained   relatively unchanged since her debut in 2014. With this rework, we wanted to   preserve her relative mechanical simplicity, but give her other ways to show   mastery of game knowledge. Additionally, we wanted to expand upon her fantasy   of being the enthusiastic sidekick who’s not afraid to put herself in danger   to save her allies. With the new cooldown reduction mechanic on her trait, Li   Li players are encouraged to dart in and out of skirmishes, taking just enough   damage to keep her trait up. The longer she can keep her trait up, the more   ability casts she gets, pushing her into a powerful sustain support role. With   this mechanic she can also bully enemies that lack sustained damage; slowly   forcing them out of lanes or off objectives. However, she’s fairly vulnerable   to crowd control since she relies so heavily on frequent spell casts to   survive. One well timed stun or silence can shut down an overly reckless Li   Li. We’re aware that her Blinding Wind damage build was popular and that many   players preferred her in that role, but we felt it was inappropriate for Li Li   to put out the numbers she did while still providing decent support for her   team. In general, we’re nudging our supports away from being as effective as   Assassins or Specialists in terms of damage and wave clear potential. Li Li   can still put out impressive numbers for a support, but it should be much more   predicated on her ability to position properly and keep her trait up, rather   than simply being constant oppressive force. \n\n            "},{"name":"2017-06-13 Patch Notes v 2.26.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20838723","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [b]Talents[/b] [list] [b]Level 20[/b] [list] Bolt of the Storm (Active) [list] [*]Removed  \n[/list] [/list] [/list] \n            "},{"name":"2017-05-10 Balance Update v 2.25.3 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20720245","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [b]Abilities[/b] [list] [b]Cloud Serpent (W)[/b] [list] [*]Damage reduced from 29 to 25 [/list] [b]Blinding Wind (E)[/b] [list] [*]Cooldown increased from 8 to 9 seconds [*]Mana cost increased from 30 to 35 [/list] [/list] [b]Talents[/b] [list] [b]Level 1[/b] [list] Gale Force (E) [list] [*]Damage bonus reduced from 50 to 40% [/list] [/list] [b]Level 7[/b] [list] Lightning Serpent (W) [list] [*]Damage reduced from 15 to 14 [/list] [/list] [/list] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] While we’re happy that we’re seeing more Lili due   to her recent buffs, they have gone a bit far in making the hero too powerful,   particularly in double-support compositions.

We have removed it from a few Heroes and have added   new flavorful versions to a few others. We have always liked the design and   gameplay behind the Talent, but also realize how much players had to give up   in order to pick them. Wingman, Pixie Charm, and Covert Mission are being   reintroduced to Falstad, Brightwing, and Nova, respectively, with design   mechanics more suited to each Hero’s unique style of play. Additionally, we’re removing the majority of our old Relentless-   like Talents from the game, because we found that it wasn’t clear to the enemy   team what was happening. Reducing the duration on very short disabling effects   to begin with was hard to notice, and typically felt like a bug when it did   happen. In some cases, we’re replacing these Talents with Hero specific ones   that more clearly convey what’s happening, while fitting the gameplay of the   Hero. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-07-20 Hotfix Patch v 19.1 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20176357","content":"\n              \n[h]Bug Fixes[/h] \n              [list] [*][b]Azmodan:[/b] Bonus Globe of Annihilation damage earned via Taste for Blood can now properly stack up to a maximum of 500 damage, rather than 250.

At 70   seconds we think this talent is still a great level 20 pick, but now players   will have to be more strategic with how they use it. Forcing someone to use   their Bolt to avoid a gank can now be a meaningful moment with this increased   cooldown. We hope this also entices players towards choosing their Heroic   upgrades instead of Bolt when the situation calls for it. \n[list] [*]Cooldown increased from 40 to 70 seconds [/list] \n              [b]Imposing Presence[/b] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Statistically, it was almost never wrong to choose   Imposing Presence. With this nerf, it’s still a great counter in the right   situation, and as a result, we’re hoping we’ll see more play from our Basic   Attack assassins. \n[list] [*]Attack Speed slow reduced from 50% to 40% [*]The Attack Speed slow will now be removed when attacking a target that has not learned the Imposing Presence Talent [/list] \n              [b]Mercenary Lord[/b] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] We’ve combined the talent Superiority into   Mercenary Lord, and removed the damage reduction from structures to prevent   degenerative backdoor strategies. The combination of the damage reduction vs.   Mercenaries and the ability to empower these Mercenaries felt like a logical   pairing. We hope incorporating the two talents into one will make this level 4   choice an enticing one, as the two talents separated had a low pick rate. \n[list] The functionality of the Superiority Talent has been rolled into Mercenary Lord, which is now available to the following Heroes at Level 4: [list] [*]Anub'arak, Arthas, Azmodan, Gazlowe, Nazeebo, Sonya, Stitches, and The Lost Vikings [/list] [*]New combined functionality reads: Non-Boss Mercenaries near your Hero deal 50% more damage.

We   think this build is a ton of fun, so we didn’t want to negatively impact this   build. Instead, we wanted to give Azmodan some other build options. Right now,   it’s almost always a mistake to summon one of his Demons and waste your mana.   With the new tuning, and the talent changes, the Demons become a legitimate   option to use. The Demons start with much more damage than previously, but   scale close to what they use to be at higher levels. For players who still   plan to go the (Q) build, it’s mostly the same, but we’ve offered a few   additional talent choices to make options that best fit your play style.   Finally, we are removing some of the Support nature of Healing Ward and Storm   Shield from Azmodan. It makes more sense for him to be a greedy character, not   someone who can become a hybrid support in the right situation. \n[list] [*]Healing Ward (Talent) removed [*]Superiority (Talent) removed [*]First Aid (Talent) removed [*]Storm Shield (Talent) removed [*]Mercenary Lord (Talent) moved from Level 7 to Level 4 [b]New Talent (Level 4): Sin’s Grasp[/b] [list] [*]Activate to deal 115 (+19 per level) damage over 6 seconds to the target enemy Hero; can be cast while channeling All Shall Burn [*]Minion kills each reduce Sin’s Grasp’s 100 second cooldown by 5 seconds [/list] [b]New Talent (Level 7): Gluttonous Ward[/b] [list] [*]Activate to place a ward that restores 25% of Azmodan’s maximum Health and Mana over 10 seconds [/list] [b]General of Hell (Trait) (D)[/b] [list] [*]Bound Minion (Talent) moved from Level 4 to Level 7 New Talent (Level 20): Forced Recruitment [list] [*]Reduces General of Hell’s cooldown from 30 to 20 seconds [*]Allows Azmodan to store up to two General of Hell charges [/list] [/list] [b]Globe of Annihilation (Q)[/b] [list] [b]New Talent (Level 13): Hedonism[/b] [list] [*]Reduces Globe of Annihilation’s Mana cost from 60 to 30 [/list] [/list] [b]Summon Demon Warrior (W)[/b] [list] [*]Demon Warrior damage changed from 20 (+3 per level) per second to 40 (+2 per level) per second [*]Enduring Warriors (Talent) removed [*]Blazing Demons (Talent) removed Army of Hell (Talent) [list] [*]No longer increases maximum Demon charges [*]Now increases Demon Warrior damage by 20%, and reduces Demon Warrior's Mana cost from 40 to 20 [/list] Hellforged Armor (Talent) [list] [*]Now also causes Demon Warriors to deal 10 (+1 per level) damage per second to nearby enemies [/list] [/list] [b]All Shall Burn (E)[/b] [list] [*]Spare Nothing (Talent) removed Master of Destruction (Talent) moved from Level 7 to Level 1 [list] [*]Now also increases damage against Structures by 25% [/list] [b]New Talent (Level 7): Infused Power[/b] [list] [*]All Shall Burn gains an additional charge-up level, increasing its damage by 25% [/list] [/list] [/list] \n            "},{"name":"2015-06-30 Patch Notes v 12.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19803324","content":"\n              \n[h]Talents[/h] \n              [b]Blood for Blood[/b] [list] [*]No longer slows the target \n[*]Damage decreased from 15% to 10% of the target’s maximum Health \n[*]Heal amount increased from 100% to 200% of damage dealt \n[/list] \n              Hero Updates               [list] [b]General of Hell (Trait)[/b] [list] Bound Minion (Talent) [list] [*]The targeted Minion no longer gains 300% increased Health and 100% increased damage [*]Instead, the Minion now takes 75% reduced damage from non-Heroic targets, and deals 100% bonus damage to non-Heroic targets \n[/list] [/list] [/list] \n            "},{"name":"2015-05-12 Patch Notes v 11.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19067455","content":"\n              \n[h]Talents[/h] \n              [b]Healing Ward[/b] [list] [*]Can now be struck by Area of Effect Abilities \n[*]Healing Wards now have 50 (+15 per level) Health \n[/list] \n              Hero Updates               [list] [b]General of Hell (Trait)[/b] [list] Bound Minion (Talent) [list] [*]Duration increased from 15 to 30 seconds [/list] [/list] [/list] \n            "},{"name":"2015-03-24 Patch Notes v 10.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/18401781","content":"\n              \n[h]Talents[/h] \n              [b]Blood for Blood[/b] [list] [*]This Talent has received a visual update.

For example, you see   Butcher charging your Valla, and right before impact you use Cleanse on Valla,   allowing her to immediately Vault away. The change also prevents healers from   cleansing themselves preemptively, providing a guaranteed target if the   opposing team has only secured one Cleanse. As a side note, the original   reason the Unstoppable functionality was available in the first place, was to   help alleviate some persistent CC effects like Putrid Bile. We didn’t want you   to cleanse a Putrid Bile only to have the slow immediately reapply. \n[list] [*]No longer makes the target Unstoppable for 1 second [*]Now adds Relentless to the target for 2 seconds (50% shorter CC duration) [/list] \n            "}],"leoric":[{"name":"2017-11-01 Balance Update v 2.28.5 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/21159501","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [b]Abilities[/b] [list] [b]Entomb (R)[/b] [list] [*]Cooldown reduced from 60 to 50 seconds [/list] [/list] [b]Talents[/b] [list] [b]Level 4[/b] [list] Kneel Peasants!

One of our main goals with his rework was to add   some depth into his wave clear routine. Early in development we noticed the   cadence and deliberateness of his Basic Attacks and wanted to build around   that. Between Wrath of the Bone King and the tuning changes to Skeletal Swing,   we feel like we hit that goal. The other big focuses with this update were to   remove the death state healing interactions of talents and update the talent   tree to our newer philosophies. We know it was a long time in coming, but we   appreciate your patience and look forward to your feedback! \n\n\n\n\n[b]LEVEL (TIER)[/b] [b]Leoric Talents[/b] \n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  [b]Consume Vitality (Q)[/b]  [b]Fealty Unto Death (Trait)[/b]  [b]Ossein Renewal (Active)[/b]  \n \n\n\n\n [b]4 (2)[/b]  [b]Ghastly Reach (Q)[/b]  [b]Paralyzing Rage (Q)[/b]  [b]Kneel, Peasants!

While we think it can be fun   to play a Warrior who also does a ton of damage, we also want to make sure   that Assassins have the primary role of doing high amounts of burst or   sustained damage to the enemy team. In Muradin’s case, we’re hoping to focus   him more towards being a highly durable Warrior who has a high amount of crowd   control to both peel for allies and enable kills for his team. We liked the   gameplay that Perfect Storm gave Muradin in rewarding him for hitting enemy   Heroes with Storm Bolt, and his new baseline quest should also hopefully   reward him for intelligently using Storm Bolt to secure kills due to the bonus   stacks that he will gain. Muradin’s talent tree had a lot of talents that were   not being utilized well, both from a pick and win rate perspective, so we’ve   consolidated a lot of the power of those talents in order to make his them   more competitive with one another. \n\n\n\n\n[b]LEVEL (TIER)[/b] [b]Muradin Talents[/b] \n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  Block (Passive)  (!)

Oddly enough his win rate is actually   below average in most levels of play. We realize that he brings a very   versatile kit that allows him to be a great solo-Warrior for his team. Our   main change to offset his Health is to remove the escape effectiveness of   Iron-Forged Momentum. Next week we will also be reducing the amount of Health   that Avatar provides.

While we love that   our Talents augment our Heroes in interesting ways, we are wary when a Hero is   picked specifically for a role that they are given via a Talent. We did a pass   on our current roster and found a couple of these cases in Johanna and   Muradin. We like how Johanna is seen as a warrior with good wave clear, and   how Muradin is seen as an anti- auto-attacker. We’ve decided to make these   features part of their base kits, and will be keeping an eye on others in the   future. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-07-12 Patch Notes v 19.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20164442","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [b]Abilities[/b] [list] [b]Second Wind (Trait)[/b] [list] [*]Base Heal effect increased from 1.5% to 2% maximum Health per second.

The logic   behind this change is as follows – We want to buff Muradin for all ranges of   play EXCEPT our pro-scene. Of course this is where the Unstoppable leap is   abused the most, and even though there is some great skill-cap behind knowing   when and how to use it, it gives him an incredible amount of power and   definitely hurts the pick-rates of our other Warriors. By replacing this with   a 2 second Resistant buff, it should help the vast majority of players feel   more tanky when they use Dwarf Toss, which has always been the intention. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-05-17 Patch Notes v 18.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20120032","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [list] Give ‘em the Axe!

A few Talents were a bit over or under-tuned, and he   kindly offered us his hammer in order to forge some better options. Additionally, we’ve received a lot of feedback from players   regarding the popular strategy of chaining movement impairing effects, like   Stuns and Roots, on an enemy Hero. While we want this to be a viable way to   play, we feel it’s currently too prominent and powerful at higher levels of   play. As a result, we are reducing the duration of many of these effects in   the game. In scenarios where this change nerfs a character we don’t otherwise   want to nerf, we’re coupling it with a buff to help offset the difference.   While this change hasn’t reduced all effects that might make you lose control   of your Hero, we feel these are some of the more egregious ones. As always, we   will make further changes if necessary. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-04-19 Patch Notes v 17.2 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20099322","content":"\n              \n[h]Bug Fixes[/h] \n              [list] [*]Players will no longer occasionally become locked out of issuing further commands to their Hero after being hit by Muradin’s Haymaker with the Grand Slam Talent.

Most of these are pretty   simple changes to make them more enticing, like adding more damage, reducing   cooldowns, or lowering Mana costs. We realize that the primary use case for   Abilities like Li Li’s Water Dragon or E.T.C.’s Stage Dive is not damage, but   having more of it might help them feel more effective. We’re trying to do   something a little bit different with Brightwing’s Emerald Wind and   Malfurion’s Twilight Dream by compensating for some of the Support capability   you miss out on by picking these Heroics. We’re excited to see how these go!   In Thrall’s case, Sundering was a little too strong, so we’re reducing its   stun duration. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-03-29 Patch Notes v 17.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20063493","content":"\n              \n[h]Talents[/h] \n              [b]Block[/b] [list] [*]Damage reduction increased from 50% to 75% [/list] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] We want to improve counter-pick talents like Block   that are meant to be strong against certain hero types.

We have removed it from a few Heroes and have added   new flavorful versions to a few others. We have always liked the design and   gameplay behind the Talent, but also realize how much players had to give up   in order to pick them. Wingman, Pixie Charm, and Covert Mission are being   reintroduced to Falstad, Brightwing, and Nova, respectively, with design   mechanics more suited to each Hero’s unique style of play. Additionally, we’re removing the majority of our old Relentless-   like Talents from the game, because we found that it wasn’t clear to the enemy   team what was happening. Reducing the duration on very short disabling effects   to begin with was hard to notice, and typically felt like a bug when it did   happen. In some cases, we’re replacing these Talents with Hero specific ones   that more clearly convey what’s happening, while fitting the gameplay of the   Hero. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-07-20 Hotfix Patch v 19.1 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20176357","content":"\n              \n[h]Bug Fixes[/h] \n              [list] [*][b]Raynor:[/b] Heroic Ability cooldowns will now be properly reduced when a Hero is killed after learning the A Card to Play Talent.

At 70   seconds we think this talent is still a great level 20 pick, but now players   will have to be more strategic with how they use it.

We have also received feedback that Bolt of the Storm could have   more awesome moments if its playmaking potential were more tied to offensive   use cases. Our goals with these changes are twofold: to consolidate Bolt of   the Storm to heroes where we think it makes for awesome gameplay moments, and   second to create use cases where it is more optimal to use Bolt of the Storm   to make offensive plays. We hope that these changes create more interesting   moments in the late-game where heroes can shine by making risky plays to   ensure victory for their team. \n\n            "},{"name":"2017-05-16 Patch Notes v 2.25.4 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20783378","content":"\n              \n[h]Bug Fixes[/h] \n              [list] [*][b]Tracer:[/b] Can now correctly attack Minions who are affected by Sylvanas’ Possession.

After many iterations, we think we   finally found something that can compete with Wailing Arrow. We’re excited to   bring Mind Control to the Nexus, which will allow Sylvanas to ruin an enemy’s   positioning while possibly sacrificing her own to do so. \nGiven its gravity, this change quickly led us down the rabbit hole of trying   to fix her Talent pick-rates, so we took the opportunity to look into those   while applying some of our newer Talent tree design philosophies. After the   dust had settled, we realized our changes were going to remove a bit of the   damage offered by her popular build paths, so we decided to increase her Basic   Attack and Withering Fire damage to help even things out. \n[b]Sylvanas Talents[/b] \n\n\n\n[b]Level (Tier)[/b] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  [b]Overflowing Quiver (Q)[/b]  [b]Paralysis (Trait)[/b]  Mercenary Queen  — \n\n\n [b]4 (2)[/b]  [b]Withering Barrage (Q)[/b]  [b]With the Wind (Q)[/b]  [b]Lost Soul (W)[/b]  — \n\n\n [b]7 (3)[/b]  [b]Barbed Shot (Q)[/b]  Unstable Poison (Trait)  [b]Possession[/b]  — \n\n\n [b]10 (4)[/b]  Wailing Arrow (R)  [b]Mind Control (R)[/b]  —  — \n\n\n [b]13 (5)[/b]  [b]Life Drain (W)[/b]  [b]Windrunner (E)[/b]  [b]Will of the Forsaken[/b]  Spell Shield \n\n\n [b]16 (6)[/b]  [b]Evasive Fire (Q)[/b]  Cold Embrace (W)  [b]Overwhelming Affliction[/b]  [b]Remorseless[/b] \n\n\n [b]20 (7)[/b]  Deafening Blast (R)  [b]Dark Lady's Call (R)[/b]  Fury of the Storm  Bolt of the Storm \n\n\n[list] [*][b]Italics[/b] indicates a [b]NEW[/b] Talent [*][b]Bold[/b] indicates a [b]MOVED[/b] Talent [/list] \n            "},{"name":"2016-02-02 Patch Notes v 16.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19995509","content":"\n              \n[h]Design & Gameplay[/h] \n              [b]General[/b] [list] [*]Damage dealt by splash and cleave attacks will no longer trigger effects that would otherwise require a direct attack to trigger (ex: Block, Spell Shield, Imposing Presence, etc.) [/list] \n            "},{"name":"2015-09-02 Hotfix Patch v 13.3 ","url":"https://us.battle.net/forums/en/heroes/topic/18710645758","content":"\n              \n[h]Bug Fixes[/h] \n              [list] [*]Fixed an issue that could cause Sylvanas’ Wailing Arrow to be placed on reduced cooldown despite being successfully cast.

The changes to Feral Spirit add new   opportunities for Thrall to make big plays, while allowing him to continue his   role as a lane bully, or play with the team, depending on your playstyle.   Overall, Thrall is now flush with Quest talents, and this is something we   wanted to explore and are excited for your feedback. \n\n            "},{"name":"2017-05-31 Balance Update v 2.25.5 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20749068","content":"\n              \n[h]Bug Fixes[/h] \n              [list] [*][b]D.Va:[/b] Players will now correctly earn takedown credit toward certain Hero Talents and Abilities, like Seasoned Marksman or Li-Ming’s Critical Mass, after destroying D.Va’s Mech.

We decided   to remove Shrug It Off because it felt misplaced on a tier that was primarily   about Utility and Mobility. To compensate for the loss of Shrug It Off, we’ve   decided to buff his baseline Health and Regeneration and the other Talent   options at level 1.

A core part of Tychus’ gameplay now centers around his effectiveness   against targets that have a lot of Health. \nAs part of this update, we made an effort to pit Talents with similar uses   against one another so that players aren’t focused on going down a single   build path, such as picking every survivability option. \n[b]Tychus Talents[/b] \n\n\n\n[b]Level (Tier)[/b] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  [b]Shrug it Off (E)[/b]  [b]Press the Advantage (E)[/b]  Dash (E)  [b]Combat Tactician (E)[/b] \n\n\n [b]4 (2)[/b]  [b]In the Rhythm (Trait)[/b]  [b]Fully Loaded (Trait)[/b]  [b]The Bigger They Are… (Trait)[/b]  [b]Master Assassin[/b] \n\n\n [b]7 (3)[/b]  Quarterback (W)  [b]Concussion Grenade (W)[/b]  [b]Relentless Soldier[/b]  — \n\n\n [b]10 (4)[/b]  Commandeer Odin (R)  Drakken Laser Drill (R)  —  — \n\n\n [b]13 (5)[/b]  [b]That’s the Stuff![/b]  [b]Neosteel Coating[/b]  [b]Spray ‘n’ Pray (Q)[/b]  — \n\n\n [b]16 (6)[/b]  [b]Titan Grenade (W)[/b]  [b]Lead Rain (Q)[/b]  [b]Armor Piercing Rounds (Q)[/b]  — \n\n\n [b]20 (7)[/b]  Big Red Button (R)  Focusing Diodes (R)  [b]Sizzlin’ Attacks[/b]  [b]Bob and Weave (E)[/b] \n\n\n[list] [*][b]Italics[/b] indicates a [b]NEW[/b] Talent [*][b]Bold[/b] indicates a [b]MOVED[/b] Talent [/list] \n            "},{"name":"2016-03-01 Patch Notes v 16.3 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20049139","content":"\n              \n[h]Bug Fixes[/h] \n              [list] [*]Fixed an issue that could cause Tychus to walk or stand while Mounted.

This occurred if players kept a summon alive for a   very long time and gained Ability Power via Talents, like Gathering Power, as   this increase in Ability Power was not passed onto the Summon. Short term   summons or persistent effects will still take a snapshot of your current   Ability Power at the time they are cast, and apply the bonus for the complete   duration of the effect. \n[list] To clarify the rules for temporary Ability Power gains, the following rules have been added: [list] For permanent or very long duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health will now update dynamically when Ability Power is modified. This includes: [list] [*]Abathur's Monstrosity [*]Nazeebo's Gargantuan (with the Humongoid Talent) [/list] For short duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health should snapshot based upon the Ability Power of the character when they are cast.

At 70   seconds we think this talent is still a great level 20 pick, but now players   will have to be more strategic with how they use it. Forcing someone to use   their Bolt to avoid a gank can now be a meaningful moment with this increased   cooldown. We hope this also entices players towards choosing their Heroic   upgrades instead of Bolt when the situation calls for it. \n[list] [*]Cooldown increased from 40 to 70 seconds [/list] \n              [b]Focused Attacks[/b] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] This could be viewed as a buff or nerf depending   on how players perceive it. You can still reduce the cooldown by attacking   Minions, but won’t accidently waste a burst of damage on an unintended target.   This talent will no longer be as effective at sieging, but it should be   significantly better at harassing in lane. We will continue to monitor the   talent, and tune as necessary. \n[list] [*]The increased damage effect will now only trigger when hitting Heroes [/list] \n              Bug Fixes               [list] [*]Fixed an issue in which Ability effects, such as Giant Killer, Focused Attack, and Zagara’s Envenomed Spines, could be applied while Blinded.

The roots of the redesign have been floating around   the design bullpen for 6+ months, and after some initial testing we felt like   we had to pull the trigger and get it out to you. \nSimilar to Zagara and our other large reworks, we didn’t want to change the   ‘feel’ of the Hero —Valla users should still feel completely at home while   playing her. Our main goal was to increase the potential for amazing Valla   players to differentiate themselves from the mediocre ones and aimed the   majority of these changes toward lifting her skill-ceiling. We believe that   players will still be able to build Valla very similarly to the ways they have   in the past, but with more interesting and potentially powerful payoffs. We   are excited to bring the new Valla to our community and look forward to   hearing what you all think! \n[b]Valla Talents[/b] \n\n\n\n[b]Level (Tier)[/b] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  Monster Hunter (Q)  [b](!)

She had, by far, the unhealthiest Talent Tree in Heroes and we   spent months going through multiple iterations of her Design. We knew exactly   what we wanted to keep in her play-style: Lane Bully, Summoner, and Scout, and   we aimed all of our decisions at those three characteristics. We also decided   to upgrade her talent tree to better embrace our new design philosophies.   Overall, we hope you enjoy her new tools while continuing to feel like you’re   playing the old Zagara that we know and love. \n[b]Zagara Talents[/b] \n\n\n\n[b]Level (Tier)[/b] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  [b]Volatile Acide (Q)[/b]  Corpse Feeders (E)  [b]Infest[/b] \n\n\n [b]4 (2)[/b]  Envenomed Spines  Medusa Blades  [b]New: (!)

We wanted to increase the cooldown reduction granted by the Talent,   but didn’t want Heroic Ability cooldowns to drop to absurdly low levels. By   making it only reduce the cooldowns of Basic Abilities (Q, W, E), it allowed   us to increase this cooldown reduction without making it overpowered. We’ve   also made Battle Momentum Hero-specific, so that we can tune each one without   affecting all the rest, since Attack Speed, melee versus range, and the nature   of your Basic Abilities can all drastically change what is balanced. \n\n              Bug Fixes               [list] [*]Right-clicking an enemy Structure while channeling Zagara’s Baneling Barrage will no longer cause her to move to that Structure without attacking it.

Unfortunately, it was always a difficult choice to make when the time to pick   Heroics came about. Taz'Dingo's synergy with his heavy attack-damage nature   was very difficult to pass up. While we did not want to mess with a winning   combination, we did want to augment his standard build and give the old troll   some shiny new tools in which to help quickly dispatch his foes. His baseline   quest is focused directly at what he does best and should help him feel   progressively more potent as the match unravels. As with all of our reworks,   we are extremely excited to hear what you think and greatly appreciate any   feedback you have! \n\n\n\n\n[b]LEVEL (TIER)[/b] [b]Zul'jin Talents[/b] \n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  Boneslicer (Q)  [b]Recklessness (Passive)[/b]  [b](!)

Most of these are pretty   simple changes to make them more enticing, like adding more damage, reducing   cooldowns, or lowering Mana costs. We realize that the primary use case for   Abilities like Li Li’s Water Dragon or E.T.C.’s Stage Dive is not damage, but   having more of it might help them feel more effective. We’re trying to do   something a little bit different with Brightwing’s Emerald Wind and   Malfurion’s Twilight Dream by compensating for some of the Support capability   you miss out on by picking these Heroics. We’re excited to see how these go!   In Thrall’s case, Sundering was a little too strong, so we’re reducing its   stun duration. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-03-29 Patch Notes v 17.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20063493","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [list] [b]Ultimate Evolution (R)[/b] [list] [*]Will now inherit Kharazim's Trait [/list] [/list] \n            "},{"name":"2016-03-09 Balance Update v 16.4 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20058183","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [list] [b]Symbiote (Q)[/b] [list] [b]Carapace (E)[/b] [list] [*]Shield amount increased from 137 (+4% per level) to 150 (+4% per level) [/list] [/list] [b]Toxic Nest (W)[/b] [list] Vile Nest (Talent) [list] [*]Slow amount decreased from 50% to 40% [*]Slow duration reduced from 4 to 3 seconds [/list] [/list] [/list] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] It’s extremely difficult bartering with a space   slug.

A lot of our Warriors were getting Armor   updates in this patch and originally Cho’gall was no exception. After playing   with a generic form of it internally, we realized we had a once-in-a-Nexus   opportunity to do something very different and seized the moment. The   foundation of the Cho’gall rework revolves around their new Traits, Ogre Hide   and Ogre Rage, which are the keys to success with the Hero. The potential of   Cho’gall should be greater than ever, but you will have to make sure both   heads are working together in order to maximize your damage output while   keeping yourself alive long enough to keep doing it. \n\n\n\n\n[b]LEVEL (TIER)[/b] \n[b]CHO TALENTS[/b] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  [b]Consuming Fire (W)[/b]  (!)

In some cases, we’re replacing these Talents with Hero specific ones   that more clearly convey what’s happening, while fitting the gameplay of the   Hero. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-08-24 Balance Update v 19.5 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20245464","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [b]Talents[/b] [list] [b]Level 7[/b] [list] [b]I AM Hurrying!

A lot of our Warriors were getting Armor   updates in this patch and originally Cho’gall was no exception. After playing   with a generic form of it internally, we realized we had a once-in-a-Nexus   opportunity to do something very different and seized the moment. The   foundation of the Cho’gall rework revolves around their new Traits, Ogre Hide   and Ogre Rage, which are the keys to success with the Hero. The potential of   Cho’gall should be greater than ever, but you will have to make sure both   heads are working together in order to maximize your damage output while   keeping yourself alive long enough to keep doing it. \n\n\n\n\n[b]LEVEL (TIER)[/b] \n[b]Gall TALENTS[/b] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  [b]Keep Moving!

We wanted to increase the cooldown reduction granted by the Talent,   but didn’t want Heroic Ability cooldowns to drop to absurdly low levels. By   making it only reduce the cooldowns of Basic Abilities (Q, W, E), it allowed   us to increase this cooldown reduction without making it overpowered. We’ve   also made Battle Momentum Hero-specific, so that we can tune each one without   affecting all the rest, since Attack Speed, melee versus range, and the nature   of your Basic Abilities can all drastically change what is balanced. \n\n              [b]Regeneration Master[/b] [list] A reward has been added to this Questing Talent.

Upon completing its quest, players will be provided with some additional   power. This allows us to offer spikes of power in-between Talent levels, or   even for a single player on a team. Now, simply picking the Talent and only   partially completing it is worse, but finishing the quest will return a larger   reward. Choosing the right Talents on the right Battleground or with the right   team composition has always been an important goal for us, and this change   pushes this Talent to closer align with that goal. \n\n              Hero Updates               [list] [b]Iron Skin (Trait) (D)[/b] [list] [*]Shield amount increased from 613 (+4% per level) to 674 (+4% per level).

We realize that the primary use case for   Abilities like Li Li’s Water Dragon or E.T.C.’s Stage Dive is not damage, but   having more of it might help them feel more effective. We’re trying to do   something a little bit different with Brightwing’s Emerald Wind and   Malfurion’s Twilight Dream by compensating for some of the Support capability   you miss out on by picking these Heroics. We’re excited to see how these go!   In Thrall’s case, Sundering was a little too strong, so we’re reducing its   stun duration. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-03-29 Patch Notes v 17.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20063493","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [list] Reinforce (Talent) [list] [*]Damage reduction amount increased from 50% to 75% [/list] [/list] \n              Bug Fixes               [list] [*]Regeneration Globes will now properly grant healing and Regeneration Master stacks when collected as a Shield expires.

[/list] [/list] [/list] \n[b][b]Developer Comment:[/b][/b] Our big two goals for the Lt. Morales changes were   to offer a bit more variety in the viability of her talent choices, and to   increase the amount of utility she brings to the field. In the past, Lt.   Morales tended towards a passive play-style, where talents that increased her   survivability were usually the best options because her base kit was already   very strong. This can be very frustrating for team compositions that lacked   specific tools to deal with her. With how much raw healing output she offers,   we found it hard to inject more power into her other abilities or talents   without it affecting her overall balance or play style. We found a solution to   both these problems in her new energy system. Morales players should still be   able to keep their team alive for long periods of time, but, with pressure,   clever enemies can exhaust her energy and eventually run her down. Although   this does add an additional layer of complexity to Lt. Morales, it is offset   by a new set of tools that skilled players can leverage to keep her team happy   and healthy. \n\n\n\n\n[b]LEVEL (TIER)[/b] [b]Lt.

The goal of the revamp was   to increase the reward of mastering the Hero’s Abilities, maintain his   identity as a zone control and damage over time character, embrace the fun   mini-game that was Death Ritual, and provide interesting synergies between   Abilities and Talents. We wanted to be sure to reinforce the designed   weaknesses of the Hero that are lack of burst and lack of mobility, while   still making him viable in the current metagame of Heroes of the Storm.   Overall, a lot of his old Talents had to be revamped or replaced, but we find   that he still feels a lot like the old Nazeebo, just more interesting! \n\n\n\n\n[b]Level (Tier)[/b] \n[b]Nazeebo Talents[/b] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  [b](!)

This occurred if players kept a summon alive for a   very long time and gained Ability Power via Talents, like Gathering Power, as   this increase in Ability Power was not passed onto the Summon. Short term   summons or persistent effects will still take a snapshot of your current   Ability Power at the time they are cast, and apply the bonus for the complete   duration of the effect. \n[list] To clarify the rules for temporary Ability Power gains, the following rules have been added: [list] For permanent or very long duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health will now update dynamically when Ability Power is modified. This includes: [list] [*]Abathur's Monstrosity [*]Nazeebo's Gargantuan (with the Humongoid Talent) [/list] For short duration pets or persistent effects, their damage and maximum Health should snapshot based upon the Ability Power of the character when they are cast.

At 70   seconds we think this talent is still a great level 20 pick, but now players   will have to be more strategic with how they use it. Forcing someone to use   their Bolt to avoid a gank can now be a meaningful moment with this increased   cooldown. We hope this also entices players towards choosing their Heroic   upgrades instead of Bolt when the situation calls for it. \n[list] [*]Cooldown increased from 40 to 70 seconds [/list] \n              [b]Gathering Power[/b] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Gathering Power was simply too good and was   considered, by many, a mandatory pick on certain characters, which often lead   to snowballing. We liked the ‘quest’ aspect of this talent, but it was far too   easy to reach the cap and the quest didn’t feel meaningful to complete. Now,   choosing this talent should no longer be mandatory, and the quest is much   longer. Player’s will keep half of their stacks upon dying, which will help   act as a ‘check point’. \n[list] [*]The 5% starting Ability Power has been removed [*]Percentage gain from killing a Hero reduced from 2% to 1% [*]Instead of losing all stacks on death, players will now only lose half their stacks (rounding up) [/list] \n              [b]Mercenary Lord[/b] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] We’ve combined the talent Superiority into   Mercenary Lord, and removed the damage reduction from structures to prevent   degenerative backdoor strategies. The combination of the damage reduction vs.   Mercenaries and the ability to empower these Mercenaries felt like a logical   pairing. We hope incorporating the two talents into one will make this level 4   choice an enticing one, as the two talents separated had a low pick rate. \n[list] The functionality of the Superiority Talent has been rolled into Mercenary Lord, which is now available to the following Heroes at Level 4: [list] [*]Anub'arak, Arthas, Azmodan, Gazlowe, Nazeebo, Sonya, Stitches, and The Lost Vikings [/list] [*]New combined functionality reads: Non-Boss Mercenaries near your Hero deal 50% more damage.

She has many counters, has a high   skill floor, and requires her teammates to play around her poke style. Even   anticipating the gradual increase in effectiveness as people figure her out,   we think that she has room for buffs. \nChromie is the type of Hero who has high damage potential (and man, when she   hits those home runs they’re a sight to behold), but is also very   inconsistent. She’ll always be that way to a degree, which is by design. We’re   attempting to buff her damage throughput to offset this inability to pick her   targets, without making her “one shot” potential any scarier than it is. \nWe’ve increased her Health slightly as well so that she is a little more   resistant to incidental damage. If enemies find a way to close the gap and   focus her down, her still relatively low Health and lack of escapes will allow   teams to eliminate our terrifying gnome-dragon, as they should. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-05-17 Patch Notes v 18.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20120032","content":"\n              \n[h]New Hero[/h] \n              [b]Chromie, Keeper of Time,[/b] has been added to Heroes of the Storm and is now available for play!

We liked the ‘quest’ aspect of this talent, but it was far too   easy to reach the cap and the quest didn’t feel meaningful to complete. Now,   choosing this talent should no longer be mandatory, and the quest is much   longer.

Ideally, this will become a great talent pick when facing   The Lost Vikings or Murky players. \n[list] [*]Stacks earned by killing enemy Heroes increased from 2 to 3 [*]Only Minions, captured enemy Mercenaries, and Heroes will grant stacks upon death [/list] \n              Hero Updates               \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Mighty Gust can be a great disengagement tool, but   it is often outshined by the pure power of Hinterland Blast.

With these changes,   players will get more out of Snipe Master without having to rebuild so many   stacks after a miss. We’ve heard a lot of community feedback and suggestions   about not removing stacks as long as your Snipe hits something. We’ve   discussed this, but feel that even if Snipe misses the intended target, it   still hits something the majority of the time. By making this Talent sharp,   with an obvious downside, it allows us to crank up the tuning and really   celebrate flawless Nova play. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-02-02 Patch Notes v 16.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19995509","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [list] [*]Conjurer's Pursuit (Talent) removed [*]Gathering Power (Talent) removed [*]Envenom (Talent) removed [*]Headshot (Talent) removed [*]Spell Shield (Talent) removed [*]Overdrive (Talent) removed [*]Bolt of the Storm (Talent) removed [b]Permanent Cloak, Sniper (Trait)[/b] [list] Advanced Cloaking (Talent) redesigned and moved from Level 13 to Level 1 [list] [*]Now increases Nova's Movement Speed by 30% while Cloaked [/list] [b]New Talent (Level 1): Tactical Espionage[/b] [list] [*]Regenerate 4 Mana per second while Stealthed [/list] [b]New Talent (Level 20): Ghost Protocol[/b] [list] [*]Activate to gain Stealth for 2 seconds.

When we sat down to talk about what we wanted to do for   her, we quickly realized that a slight Talent shuffle was not going to be   possible. We wanted to keep her playstyle as similar to live as possible while   also addressing some of our core concerns with her, which were: [list] [*]She can be very frustrating to play against for newer players. [*]She isn’t viable in competitive play. [*]Her Talent pick rates were not great. [/list] This new direction for Nova addresses the first two issues by lowering her   overall burst potential, while increasing her damage output overall. The most   noticeable way we did this was through lowering both her Snipe cooldown and   damage. For the third concern, we decided to do an overarching sweep of her   Talents, removing the ones that weren’t working, and created some new ones   that should offer interesting choices that promote Nova’s roaming and ganking   nature. We realize that this is a slight departure from her long history of   burst damage, but feel it is a better direction for her in the long run. We   are watching her very carefully in order to react quickly and tune   accordingly. \n\n              Bug Fixes               [list] [*]Murky’s Egg will no longer briefly display on the minimap if he is killed by Nova’s Pinning Shot.

Earthgrasp Totem’s slow duration was nerfed slightly because we found the   duration of such a powerful slow on a short cooldown was pretty frustrating to   play against. \n\n              Bug Fixes               [list] [*]The Rewind Talent will no longer affect Rehgar's Ghost Wolf cooldown.

As our philosophies grow   and change, we attempt to utilize them in our Hero updates. Rehgar’s changes   were driven by this, and will help us learn even more in the future. Here’s a   very brief explanation: [list] Rehgar was usually brought to teams as a main support, which meant   players were heavily incentivized to pick every healing option available to   him. We tried to rectify this by placing healing Talents against each other on   the same Talent tier. Of course, this removes some of his healing power as   players cannot stack each Talent, so we also increased his base power to   compensate. Our hope is that these changes will allow Rehgar players to be a   more aggressive while supporting their team, which was always his design   intent.

For example, you see   Butcher charging your Valla, and right before impact you use Cleanse on Valla,   allowing her to immediately Vault away. The change also prevents healers from   cleansing themselves preemptively, providing a guaranteed target if the   opposing team has only secured one Cleanse. As a side note, the original   reason the Unstoppable functionality was available in the first place, was to   help alleviate some persistent CC effects like Putrid Bile.

Previously this was   primarily isolated to Quick Match and his overall play-rate wasn’t high enough   for us to have any major concerns. After the newest round of changes, he has   stayed true to his name in Quick Match and is beginning to pick up steam in   Ranked play. We agreed with the massive amounts of feedback that it felt odd   that a Butcher could so willingly trade his life for an enemy kill to progress   his quest. These changes to his Meat gain/loss should help bring these   situations more in-line, while the talent changes were directed fully at   bringing over and under-tuned talents closer to the power level expected at   the respective tiers. \n\n            "},{"name":"2017-08-08 Patch Notes v 2.27.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20944073","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [b]Stats[/b] [list] [*]Basic Attack damage lowered from 140 to 130 [/list] [b]Abilities[/b] [list] [b]Fresh Meat (Trait)[/b] [list] [*]Meat required to complete his quest increased from 125 to 200 [*]Damage bonus per Meat stack decreased from 1 to .5 [*]Meat dropped by enemy Heroes increased from 5 to 25 [*]Bonus damage on quest completion increased from 100 to 125 [*]Once the quest is completed, enemy Heroes continue to drop Meat, giving The Butcher 5 permanent Basic Attack damage per Meat collected [/list] [/list] [b]Talents[/b] [list] [b]Level 1[/b] [list] Abattoir (Trait) [list] [*]Removed [/list] [/list] [/list] \n              Bug Fixes               [list] [*][b]The Butcher:[/b] Fixed an issue preventing Ruthless Onslaught from activating when targeting an enemy that moves into fog of war. \n[/list] \n              [list] [*][b]Tyrael & The Butcher:[/b] Fixed an issue that allowed Sanctification to go off despite Tyrael being stunned by Ruthless Onslaught. \n[/list] \n            "},{"name":"2017-06-13 Patch Notes v 2.26.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20838723","content":"\n              \n[h]Design & Gameplay[/h] \n              [b]Talents[/b] [list] Bolt of the Storm [list] [*]Range reduced by 20% [*]New Bolt of the Storm alternatives have been added to several Heroes [/list] [/list] \n[b][b]Developer Comment:[/b][/b] While we love Bolt of the Storm and the playmaking   potential that it provides, we believe that the talent is too often used as an   extra escape.

To give   you an idea of what we were looking to improve, here were a couple of our   goals with this update: Chen should be able to be a solo-tank for your team   and not be afraid to constantly soak enemy skill-shots. Chen should be a   constant threat to the enemy’s backline damage dealers. Chen should deal low   amounts of burst damage while continually applying sustained damage at pointed   targets. Chen should be extremely resilient in the absence of enemy stuns. As   always, we are listening to your feedback and appreciate everyone taking the   time to send it to us.

The rework was focused on lowering the power of   her healing while greatly strengthening her utility and damage output. Our   data is showing that we are meeting those goals but realize that a lot of   players are still attempting to solo-support with her. We are actively aware   of the Support role-perception issue, especially since it transcends just   Tyrande, and are exploring a lot of different options to help alleviate the   frustrations. \n\n            "},{"name":"2017-06-28 Balance Update v 2.26.1, 2.26.2 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20861968","content":"\n              \n[h]Bug Fixes[/h] \n              [list] [*][b]Tyrande:[/b] The Bonus Damage amount that appears in Ranger's buff bar tooltip will now update properly. \n[/list] \n            "},{"name":"2017-06-13 Patch Notes v 2.26.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20838723","content":"\n              \n[h]Bug Fixes[/h] \n              [list] [*][b]Basic Attacks:[/b] Splash and Cleave damage will now correctly reveal targets who are hit while inside Bushes and Vents.

It felt like the self-heal mechanic was better suited on a   front-line melee Healer, so we gave it to our favorite paladin in his latest   rework. Instead of simply removing functionality from Light of Elune, we   decided to add a large amount of cooldown reduction with every Basic Attack.   This will reward players that can stay in combat and has allowed us to shift   some of her power from healing output into more utility and offensive-based   areas. Overall, we are extremely excited to see what our players can do with   her new kit and look forward to hearing any feedback you have! \n\n\n\n\n[b]LEVEL (TIER)[/b] \n[b]Tyrande Talents[/b] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  (!)

We wanted to increase the cooldown reduction granted by the Talent,   but didn’t want Heroic Ability cooldowns to drop to absurdly low levels. By   making it only reduce the cooldowns of Basic Abilities (Q, W, E), it allowed   us to increase this cooldown reduction without making it overpowered. We’ve   also made Battle Momentum Hero-specific, so that we can tune each one without   affecting all the rest, since Attack Speed, melee versus range, and the nature   of your Basic Abilities can all drastically change what is balanced. \n\n              [b]Seasoned Marksman[/b] [list] A reward has been added to this Questing Talent.

Now, simply picking the Talent and only   partially completing it is worse, but finishing the quest will return a larger   reward. Choosing the right Talents on the right Battleground or with the right   team composition has always been an important goal for us, and this change   pushes this Talent to closer align with that goal. \n\n              Bug Fixes               [list] [*]Attempting to cast Nova’s Pinning Shot or Tyrande’s Hunter’s Mark on an enemy just as the target enters a Bush or Vent will no longer cause the Ability’s sound effects and animations to play as though it were successfully cast.

We realize that the primary use case for   Abilities like Li Li’s Water Dragon or E.T.C.’s Stage Dive is not damage, but   having more of it might help them feel more effective. We’re trying to do   something a little bit different with Brightwing’s Emerald Wind and   Malfurion’s Twilight Dream by compensating for some of the Support capability   you miss out on by picking these Heroics.

We are happy with how versatile her   kit is, but feel she does everything a bit too well, especially since she   thrives in the current stun-driven meta. We have changes targeted at improving   her talent diversity while forcing her to rely a bit more on talents for   damage or healing output. We are taking a cautious approach here, but are more   than willing to make larger changes, if necessary. \n\n            "},{"name":"2015-11-17 Patch Notes v 15.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19960704","content":"\n              \n[h]Bug Fixes[/h] \n              [list] [*]Heal over time and damage over time previews for Tyrande’s Shadowstalk and Kael'thas’ Living Bomb will now more accurately reflect the burst Healing and burst damage amounts at the end of each Ability’s effects.

Her new baseline quest to unlock Improved Ice Block should allow for more play   making potential, which we are adding as a response to players who were   disappointed when we moved the talent to Level 20. We also heard feedback from   many players that the removal of Bolt of the Storm off of heroes like Jaina   has hurt their play making ability and overall fun, so we're going back a bit   on our decision to take it away on her. While we want to be more careful where   we add these Blink-type abilities, we believe there is a place for it on   Jaina, and have added an offensive use case which should hopefully allow her   to make more aggressive plays in the late game. \n\n\n\n\n[b]LEVEL (TIER)[/b] [b]Jaina Talents[/b] \n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  Winter's Reach (Q)  Lingering Chill (Trait)  [b](!)

We want to   play up her ability to deny areas of the battlefield with Blizzard, and really   punish enemies who get stuck inside it. The biggest change in that regard is   that she now spawns 3 waves of Blizzard baseline. To go along with these core   kit changes, we’ve also changed or moved around a few of her Talents. One of   the biggest changes was Snowstorm, which increased the radius of Blizzard, as   we found that it lowered the difficulty of landing consecutive Blizzard waves   on enemies too much for a Talent in such an early tier. \n\n              Bug Fixes               [list] [*][b]Jaina:[/b] Casting Blizzard while hidden within a Shrub will no longer prevent players who are outside that shrub from seeing its visual effects.

While there was always the potential for big plays with   Bolt, we found that it was more often used as a “get out of jail free card”   that helped make up for sloppy positioning after reaching level 20. We’re in   the process of evaluating whether or not Bolt should be available to a number   of Heroes, which is why it was also removed it from Kael’thas in this patch. \nThis doesn’t mean that no burst Assassins should have this type of mobility;   it’s part of Li-Ming’s core gameplay design, for example. For the types of   ranged Heroes for which Bolt is appropriate, we balance around their mobility.   For Jaina and Kael’thas, however, we think removing Bolt and compensating them   in other ways will result in healthier gameplay and Talent diversity. \n\n              Bug Fixes               [list] [*]Jaina’s Basic Attacks will now properly refund Mana after learning the Arcane Intellect Talent.

Across the board   Lightning Surge is slightly under-performing, so we’re upping the power of the   base ability and its related talents. We hope that this will properly reward   Alarak players who take Lightning Surge related talents, particularly those   who master the gameplay of clotheslining enemies with the Lightning. When we   first designed Counter-Strike, we felt that crowd control was an appropriate   counter to the ability since it was so powerful on paper and on a reasonably   low cooldown. Since his release, we have seen that Counter-Strike is simply   not as reliable as we had predicted since Alarak has 3 potential ways to fail   to get value (enemies can fail to damage him, they can dodge the returning   skill shot, or they can crowd control him out of his channel). We’ve decided   to grant him Unstoppable for its duration to make it more reliable, and we are   increasing its damage to further separate it from Deadly Charge. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-09-13 Patch Notes v 20.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20243513","content":"\n              \n[h]New Hero[/h] \n              Not all heroes are born of altruism. . . some, like Alarak, simply desire vengeance.

The goal of the Talent   system is to provide meaningful and tactical decisions, and this just hasn’t   been the case with Illidan. His new Talent tree puts damage, survivability,   and utility options within their own tiers, and allows you to customize how   you want to do those things based upon your opponents and your preferred   playstyle. \nWe also wanted to really embrace the skill cap required to play Illidan while   not making him too difficult to pick up and learn. Some of his Talents are now   harder to pull off, but offer much higher bonuses if you’re able to use them   effectively. If those aren’t for you, then you can always pick the Talents   that are more consistent and easier to use. \nFinally, we buffed Illidan’s base kit to make up for losing some of the   Talents that he was previously relying on. Overall, we think Illidan is now a   lot more fun to play, and that you won’t know exactly what your Talent build   will be until you’re in a game. \n[b]Illidan Talents[/b] \n\n\n\n[b]Level (Tier)[/b] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  [b]Immolation (W)[/b]  Battered Assault (W)  [b]Unending Hatred[/b]  — \n\n\n [b]4 (2)[/b]  [b]Rapid Chase (Q)[/b]  [b]Friend or Foe (Q)[/b]  [b]Unbound (W)[/b]  — \n\n\n [b]7 (3)[/b]  Reflexive Block (Q)  [b]Thirsting Blade (Trait)[/b]  [b]Hunter's Onslaught (Trait)[/b]  — \n\n\n [b]10 (4)[/b]  Metamorphosis (R)  The Hunt (R)  —  — \n\n\n [b]13 (5)[/b]  [b]Nimble Defender (W)[/b]  [b]Elusive Strike (E)[/b]  Sixth Sense (E)  — \n\n\n [b]16 (6)[/b]  Marked for Death (Q)  [b]Fiery Brand[/b]  [b]Blades of Azzinoth (W)[/b]  — \n\n\n [b]20 (7)[/b]  Demonic Form (R)  Nowhere to Hide (R)  Nexus Blades  Bolt of the Storm \n\n\n[list] [*][b]Italics[/b] indicates a [b]NEW[/b] Talent [*][b]Bold[/b] indicates a [b]MOVED[/b] Talent [/list] \n            "},{"name":"2016-02-02 Patch Notes v 16.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/19995509","content":"\n              \n[h]Design & Gameplay[/h] \n              [b]Battleground Monsters[/b] [list] [*]Battleground-specific creatures are now universally defined as [b]Monsters[/b] (ex: Neutral Garden Terrors, Sky Temple Guardians, etc.) Several Talents and Abilities have been changed to reflect this new categorization, and the following no longer affect Monsters: [list] [*]Mercenary Lord [*]Johanna's Knight Takes Pawn [*]Lunara's Cruel Bloom [*]Rexxar's Easy Prey and Bird of Prey [*]The Butcher's Chop Meat [/list] The following now affect Monsters: [list] [*]Anub'arak's Beetle, Juiced [*]Azmodan's Demonic Smite [/list] [*]Several Talents that could previously trigger against both captured Mercenaries and Minions will now only affect Minions (ex: Seasoned Marksman, Black Soulstone, etc.) [/list] \n              Hero Updates               [list] [*]Basic Attack damage increased from 74 (+4% per level) to 78(+4% per level) [/list] \n            "},{"name":"2015-10-14 Hotfix Patch v 14.1 ","url":"https://us.battle.net/forums/en/heroes/topic/19288269225","content":"\n              \n[h]Bug Fixes[/h] \n              [list] [*]Fixed an issue that allowed Illidan to cast The Hunt with a reduced cooldown.

At 70   seconds we think this talent is still a great level 20 pick, but now players   will have to be more strategic with how they use it.

We wanted to increase the cooldown reduction granted by the Talent,   but didn’t want Heroic Ability cooldowns to drop to absurdly low levels. By   making it only reduce the cooldowns of Basic Abilities (Q, W, E), it allowed   us to increase this cooldown reduction without making it overpowered. We’ve   also made Battle Momentum Hero-specific, so that we can tune each one without   affecting all the rest, since Attack Speed, melee versus range, and the nature   of your Basic Abilities can all drastically change what is balanced. \n\n              Hero Updates               [list] [b]Summon Ultralisk (R)[/b] [list] [*]Cooldown reduced from 80 to 70 seconds.

[/list] [/list] [/list] [/list] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] One of our major goals with Hero reworks is   attempting to keep as many of the current builds and playstyles that exist for   a Hero, trim out older or unhealthy ones, and hopefully open doors for new   ones to emerge. When shifting the old Khala’s Embrace to a questing talent   (Khaydarin Resonance), we had hoped to lock the immense power that it brought   behind a barrier that was difficult to overcome on a lot of maps. In theory,   this would make it feel rewarding to take on certain maps, but rarely the most   powerful choice. Instead, we found that locking this kind of potential behind   an extremely difficult Globe-collecting talent made for a more frustrating   experience than a fun one. When taking a step back and considering our   options, we felt it best to remove the permanent shielding capabilities and   replace it with a less-powerful questing talent. \n\n            "},{"name":"2017-02-14 Patch Notes v 23.3 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20554028","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [b]Stats[/b] [list] [*]Basic Attack range increased from 5.5 to 6.5 [/list] [b]Abilities[/b] [list] [b]Psionic Storm (W)[/b] [list] [*]Ramp to maximum damage reduced from 8 to 5 stacks [/list] [b]Archon (R)[/b] [list] [*]​Basic Attack slow reduced from 40 to 30% [/list] [b]Force Wall (R)[/b] [list] [*]​Cooldown reduced from 12 to 10 seconds [*]Mana cost reduced from 35 to 30 [*]Duration of Force Wall reduced from 2.5 to 2 seconds [/list] [/list] [b]Talents[/b] [list] [b]Level 1[/b] [list] ​Templar’s Will (Passive) [list] [*]Mana returned from attacking Heroes increased from 4 to 8 per second New Functionality: [list] [*]Reward for first quest unlock changed from +1 Basic Attack range to +150% Distortion Beam damage.

crisis from   the moment he stepped foot into the Nexus. We knew that the design direction   and changes were going to need to be a bit more expansive in scope compared to   most of our other reworks, but we did our best to keep him as true to his High   Templar heritage as possible. Our goals were to embrace him as a true utility-   based support mage. The new \"Distortion Beam\" Basic Attack should allow you to   help peel for your allies as well as secure kills that would be otherwise   unobtainable. Plasma Shield has gained baseline utility that will continue to   empower Basic Attackers, while also offering more diverse talents in order to   better react to enemy and ally compositions. Archon has been surgically buffed   and given a passive reset for Dimensional Shift which should be great news for   our old-school fans as we fully expect to see a resurgence of back-line   infiltration play. Overall, we hope the changes reinvigorate our steadfast   Tassadar players while integrating many new ones into the Khala.

By making   Holy Light always heal Uther, he doesn’t mind as much when he takes damage   from being up there. Having his abilities apply Armor is a great way to make   him an effective support against teams with predictable damage, while having   lower healing per second compared to the other supports.

We realize that the primary use case for   Abilities like Li Li’s Water Dragon or E.T.C.’s Stage Dive is not damage, but   having more of it might help them feel more effective. We’re trying to do   something a little bit different with Brightwing’s Emerald Wind and   Malfurion’s Twilight Dream by compensating for some of the Support capability   you miss out on by picking these Heroics.

As a result, we are reducing the duration of many of these effects in   the game. In scenarios where this change nerfs a character we don’t otherwise   want to nerf, we’re coupling it with a buff to help offset the difference.   While this change hasn’t reduced all effects that might make you lose control   of your Hero, we feel these are some of the more egregious ones. As always, we   will make further changes if necessary. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-03-29 Patch Notes v 17.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20063493","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [list] [b]Cursed Strikes (W)[/b] [list] [*]Attack Speed slow now only affects Heroes and Summons [/list] [/list] \n              Bug Fixes               [list] [*]Xul’s Skeletal Mages now properly prioritize Heroes, Dragon Knights, and Garden Terrors over enemy Minions.

We know that there are a fair number of talents   that feel like they are either mandatory or insignificant, and this is our   first pass on putting in fixes. These fixes take many forms, and can range   from simply buffing or nerfing numbers to changing functionality. We’re   excited to keep our heroes feeling fresh, and you can look forward to   additional changes to more of our heroes in upcoming patches. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-05-17 Patch Notes v 18.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20120032","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [list] [b]Leap (R)[/b] [list] [*]Stun duration reduced from 1.5 to 1.25 seconds.

While we want this to be a viable way to   play, we feel it’s currently too prominent and powerful at higher levels of   play. As a result, we are reducing the duration of many of these effects in   the game. In scenarios where this change nerfs a character we don’t otherwise   want to nerf, we’re coupling it with a buff to help offset the difference.   While this change hasn’t reduced all effects that might make you lose control   of your Hero, we feel these are some of the more egregious ones.

Matthew Cooper detailed the changes on our   forums last month   explaining a bit about the new system. While the tooltips may have changed,   the actual functionality for the system has been in since the Varian patch hit   during the week of November 14, so the game itself should not feel any   different than what you are currently used to. You will also notice that we   have added baseline Armor to three Heroes – Arthas, Anub'arak, and Greymane’s   Worgen Form. These are the first of a handful that we are planning to release   and would love to hear any feedback you have. We are hoping that the Armor   System will open up future design flexibility, increase the depth of strategy   (both in game, and in draft), and grant us another knob to help balance the   game. \n\n              Hero Updates               [b]Stats[/b] [list] [*]Now has 10 Armor while in Worgen form [/list] \n            "},{"name":"2016-11-15 Patch Notes v 22.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20372990","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [b]Talents[/b] \nUndocumented [url=https:/www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5dqbe7/graymane_lvl_1_scented_tincture_stealth_removed]Source [/i][/url] [list] [b]Level 1[/b] [list] Scented Tincture (Q) [list] [*]Removed [/list] [/list] [/list] \n\n\n            "},{"name":"2016-10-18 Patch Notes v 21.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20328243","content":"\n              \n[h]Bug Fixes[/h] \n              [list] [*][b]Damage Reduction:[/b] When two damage reduction effects, such as Resistant (25%) and Hardened Shield (75%), are simultaneously applied to a Hero, the larger effect will no longer be overridden by the lesser effect.

All of Misha’s controls should now be centralized on the D button, which   should make it easier overall to play the hero. While this does result in a   tiny loss of control (Rexxar no longer has the ability to recall Misha to his   side and to keep her in a passive state), we felt that overall this   functionality was not that huge of a loss for Rexxar and was worth the gain of   making his controls centered around one button instead of two. We also made   Misha’s Movement Speeds during her various states more consistent so that she   feels better when being commanded by Rexxar, and we’ve added some talents that   should help better sell the fantasy of Rexxar and Misha working together to   take down their prey. We’ve had a blast playing with the new and improved   Rexxar, and hope that you enjoy it as much as we have! \n\n\n\n\n[b]Level (Tier)[/b] \n[b]Rexxar TALENTS[/b] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  [b]Easy Prey (Passive)[/b]  [b]Bird of Prey (Q)[/b]  Flare (Active)  \n\n\n\n [b]4 (2)[/b]  Hungry Bear (Passive)  [b](!)

New additions to   his kit include a lower cooldown and slowing Burrow Charge, a buff to his   Harden Carapace shield amount, and some buffs to his Beetle build.   Understandably some players may be wondering why we lowered his Spell Armor   when we want him to be an anti-caster, but we felt that 25 base Spell Armor   was a little too pointed in countering casters as they have no real options to   deal with it when it is on a hero baseline. By giving him these changes, we’re   hoping to make him a more well-rounded Warrior while still filling a niche   that previously did not exist in our game. [b][b]Developer Comment:[/b][/b] We’re currently doing a pass on our Warriors, and   want to better separate those that are intended to be able to solo-tank for   their team, and those who are better identified as bruisers. With Armor coming   into the game, we also saw an opportunity to make our Warriors have unique   roles for their team so that the strongest or most survivable few weren’t   identified and always favored regardless of the enemy team composition. In   this patch, we’ve taken a pass at both Arthas and Anub’arak to better embrace   their roles as solo-Warriors for their team. They have both received   significant changes, largely with the theme of adding control and/or   survivability to their kits at the cost of damage. While we know that players   enjoy putting out that DPS, we think this is a healthier direction for the   game, and should make the decision of which Warrior to bring to a team more   meaningful. We’re also hoping that this direction helps push against the trend   of it being the correct choice to bring multiple Warriors to a team because   some can bring both CC and survivability while also doing as much damage as   our Assassins. \n\n\n\n\n[b]LEVEL (TIER)[/b] \n[b]ANUB'ARAK TALENTS[/b] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  [b]Resilient Scarabs (Passive)[/b]  [b]Nerubian Armor (Passive)[/b]  (!)

Matthew Cooper detailed the changes on our   forums last month   explaining a bit about the new system. While the tooltips may have changed,   the actual functionality for the system has been in since the Varian patch hit   during the week of November 14, so the game itself should not feel any   different than what you are currently used to. You will also notice that we   have added baseline Armor to three Heroes – Arthas, Anub'arak, and Greymane’s   Worgen Form. These are the first of a handful that we are planning to release   and would love to hear any feedback you have. We are hoping that the Armor   System will open up future design flexibility, increase the depth of strategy   (both in game, and in draft), and grant us another knob to help balance the   game. \n\n              Hero Updates               [b]Stats[/b] [list] [*]Now has 25 Spell Armor [*]Health decreased from 2226 to 2003 [*]Health Regeneration decreased from 4.64 to 4.17 [/list] \n            "},{"name":"2016-12-06 Balance Update v 22.2 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20379599","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [b]Stats[/b] [list] [*]Base Health increased from 2120 to 2226 [*]Health Regeneration increased from 4.4 to 4.6 per second [/list] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Anub’arak has taken a bit of a hit since we   removed his Invulnerability from Burrow Charge.

As always is the goal with   our Hero reworks, we didn’t want to change the way he is played, but rather   amplify and improve upon it. Overall, he has felt the same to play against in   our internal testing, but with a couple new tricks up his sleeve. We hope that   our current Zeratul fans will find some new toys to play around with, and that   new users will feel more like the mobile shadow-assassin you’d expect from a   Dark Templar Hero. \n\n\n\n\n[b]Level (Tier)[/b] \n[b]Zeratul Talents[/b] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  Greater Cleave (Q)  [b]Vorpal Blade (Active)[/b]  [b](!)

Now,   choosing this talent should no longer be mandatory, and the quest is much   longer.

Alongside a lot of specialization, we need a couple generalist Warriors, and   we think E.T.C. (as well as Muradin) should fill that role. They should always   be a safe pick for your team because they fit into every team composition or   battleground, but may be outperformed by the specialized Warriors in their   ideal situations. We found that having Attack Speed on his Trait pointed him   toward Basic Attack teams and maps like Battlefield of Eternity, where   sustained damage was important. Instead, we’ve decided to add general Armor,   but wanted to make sure that it still had that fun “bard” style gameplay where   playing optimally includes spreading out abilities. We’ve updated Show Stopper   to provide less Armor, because stacking Armor makes every point more and more   valuable. Lastly, we’ve reduced Echo Pedal’s damage against non-Minions and   Mercenaries so that it’s the obvious pick when you need wave clear, but   Hammer-On and Pinball Wizard are better during a team fight. \n\n            "},{"name":"2017-03-14 Patch Notes v 24.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20581822","content":"\n              \n[h]Bug Fixes[/h] \n              [list] [*][b]E.T.C.:[/b] Echo Pedal will now correctly deal damage to Doubloon Chests on Blackheart's Bay.

We’re trying to do   something a little bit different with Brightwing’s Emerald Wind and   Malfurion’s Twilight Dream by compensating for some of the Support capability   you miss out on by picking these Heroics. We’re excited to see how these go!

We also like that Entangling Roots allows   Malfurion to make plays and initiate fights, but it’s a little too good right   now at securing kills.

While it may have been “balanced” in   terms of winrate, its potency wasn’t healthy or fun for opponents. It didn’t   offer many options for opponents that were stunned and then Taunted for over 2   seconds, greatly increasing the reliability of other abilities (like Sulfuras   Smash). By making Warbringer a massive slow instead of a stun, it allows   enemies to use abilities to defend themselves (or forces a Varian to use Taunt   early, greatly reducing the duration of his opening crowd control). We’ve   shifted more of the power of Warbringer over into the mobility aspect to   compensate (since Warbringer makes Charge a 6 second cooldown now). The other   part of these changes is providing some buffs to the Assassin focused Heroics   to bring them up to par with Taunt, so that Varian can frequently opt into any   of the Heroic choices to really fulfill the multi-class Hero fantasy that   makes him unique. \n\n            "},{"name":"2017-02-14 Patch Notes v 23.3 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20554028","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [b]Talents[/b] [list] [b]Level 13[/b] [list] Banner of Stormwind (Active) [list] [*]Moved to level 16 [/list] Banner of Ironforge (Active) [list] [*]Moved to level 16 [/list] Banner of Dalaran (Active) [list] [*]Moved to level 16 [/list] [/list] [b]Level 16[/b] [list] Juggernaut (E) [list] [*]Moved to level 13 [/list] Mortal Strike (Trait) [list] [*]Moved to level 13 [/list] Shattering Throw (Active) [list] [*]Moved to level 13 [/list] [/list] [/list] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] We like that Mortal Strike and Shattering Throw   are great counter options for certain team compositions, but thought they came   just a little too late to draft Varian specifically for them. \n\n            "},{"name":"2017-01-24 Patch Notes v 23.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20481262","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [b]Talents[/b] [list] [b]Level 1[/b] [list] Overpower (W) [list] Added functionality: [list] [*]Can now trigger multiple times per Parry [*]Now also increases the damage of the next Heroic Strike by 25% [/list] [/list] [/list] [/list] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] These simple changes should allow Varian players   to \"live the dream\" and get multiple Overpower triggers more often,   particularly when combined with Live by the Sword or Twin Blades of Fury.

These changes are designed to   nerf Warbringer's point and click stun frequency, increase the power of Shield   Wall by reducing the cooldown of Parry, greatly increase the statistical   bonuses of Taunt, and reduce some of the synergy between Second Wind and Twin   Blades of Fury that was creating so many problems for teams without a good   counter to Basic Attacks.

The intent of Spatial Echo was to   give Tracer a moment of power in comparison to the other two talents on her   tier, which are more generally useful and help her have more Blink casts   throughout a game. While its win rate was in line with other talents, its pick   rate was dominating the tier, and we weren’t happy with how much it let Tracer   use her Recall as a \"get out of jail free card\" due to the guaranteed blinks   that she would always have afterwards. Now she can still have the same moment   of power, but she will have to get in and get the kill in order to Recall out   to safety. \nTotal Recall is a great fantasy hit for us, but it comes at the cost of giving   Tracer something that she really wants in the form of self-sustain. We’re   adding the downside of increasing the cooldown of Recall to the talent in   order to make players think a little more about when they want to take the   talent. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-07-12 Patch Notes v 19.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20164442","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [b]Abilities[/b] [list] [b]Pulse Bomb (R)[/b] [list] [*]The size of the “Stuck!” text that displays on-screen when Stuck by Pulse Bomb has been reduced in order to increase visibility during gameplay [/list] [/list] \n              Bug Fixes               [list] [*][b]Tracer:[/b] Fixed an issue that could cause Pulse Bomb to launch in an unintended direction when casting Blink while Pulse Bomb is firing.

With Armor in the game, we saw the opportunity   to really embrace him being that slow approach of Death that he encapsulated   so well in Wrath of the Lich King. Arthas’s crowd control capability and   survivability have been significantly increased, and now he should really   shine as the Warrior to bring if the enemy team has multiple Melee heroes or   those who strongly rely on their auto-attacks. In return for his extra control   in teamfights, his damage has been reduced. While he will not put out damage   as quickly as before, his ability to kill enemies will now rely much more on   how long he can keep them in his Frozen Tempest, as once they’re in it will be   very difficult for them to escape without using some kind of mobility. [b][b]Developer Comment:[/b][/b] We’re currently doing a pass on our Warriors, and   want to better separate those that are intended to be able to solo-tank for   their team, and those who are better identified as bruisers. With Armor coming   into the game, we also saw an opportunity to make our Warriors have unique   roles for their team so that the strongest or most survivable few weren’t   identified and always favored regardless of the enemy team composition. In   this patch, we’ve taken a pass at both Arthas and Anub’arak to better embrace   their roles as solo-Warriors for their team. They have both received   significant changes, largely with the theme of adding control and/or   survivability to their kits at the cost of damage. While we know that players   enjoy putting out that DPS, we think this is a healthier direction for the   game, and should make the decision of which Warrior to bring to a team more   meaningful. We’re also hoping that this direction helps push against the trend   of it being the correct choice to bring multiple Warriors to a team because   some can bring both CC and survivability while also doing as much damage as   our Assassins. \n\n            "},{"name":"2017-01-24 Patch Notes v 23.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20481262","content":"\n              \n[h]Bug Fixes[/h] \n              [list] [*][b]Arthas:[/b] Army of the Dead will no longer fail to summon Ghouls if it is cast in the same moment that Arthas is targeted by Auriel’s Crystal Aegis.

Matthew Cooper detailed the changes on our   forums last month   explaining a bit about the new system. While the tooltips may have changed,   the actual functionality for the system has been in since the Varian patch hit   during the week of November 14, so the game itself should not feel any   different than what you are currently used to. You will also notice that we   have added baseline Armor to three Heroes – Arthas, Anub'arak, and Greymane’s   Worgen Form. These are the first of a handful that we are planning to release   and would love to hear any feedback you have. We are hoping that the Armor   System will open up future design flexibility, increase the depth of strategy   (both in game, and in draft), and grant us another knob to help balance the   game. \n\n              Hero Updates               [b]Stats[/b] [list] [*]Now has 15 Physical Armor [*]Health decreased from 2582 to 2404 [*]Health Regeneration decreased from 5.36 to 5.01 [/list] \n            "},{"name":"2016-10-18 Patch Notes v 21.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20328243","content":"\n              \n[h]Bug Fixes[/h] \n              [list] [*][b]Damage Reduction:[/b] When two damage reduction effects, such as Resistant (25%) and Hardened Shield (75%), are simultaneously applied to a Hero, the larger effect will no longer be overridden by the lesser effect.

In   addition to giving him some powerful new Talents befitting of the Lich King,   we also moved around and modified many of his options so that he has multiple   build paths with different playstyles. \nAdditionally, we’ve received a lot of feedback from players   regarding the popular strategy of chaining movement impairing effects, like   Stuns and Roots, on an enemy Hero. While we want this to be a viable way to   play, we feel it’s currently too prominent and powerful at higher levels of   play. As a result, we are reducing the duration of many of these effects in   the game. In scenarios where this change nerfs a character we don’t otherwise   want to nerf, we’re coupling it with a buff to help offset the difference.   While this change hasn’t reduced all effects that might make you lose control   of your Hero, we feel these are some of the more egregious ones. As always, we   will make further changes if necessary. \n[b]Arthas Talents[/b] \n\n\n\n[b]Level (Tier)[/b] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  Block  (!)

In examining Murky, his original   health and egg timers are vestiges of a different time, created before even   Jaina entered the Nexus. We wanted to give him more base health to make him a   little harder to burst down, but traded it for a little longer time to respawn   from his Egg. This has the added bonus of allowing a bit more counter-play to   hunting our fishy friend. We also wanted to adjust Pufferfish, as an   increasingly high amount of the roster could immediately explode it. Finally,   his talent tree has been updated to come in line with our new philosophies.   We’ve not only found this Murky much more fun to play as, with some exciting   talents in each tier, but also more fair to fight against!

At 70   seconds we think this talent is still a great level 20 pick, but now players   will have to be more strategic with how they use it. Forcing someone to use   their Bolt to avoid a gank can now be a meaningful moment with this increased   cooldown.

The changes to him started off as quality-of-life fixes   but eventually evolved into something of a minor rework. Overall, we tried to   even out the power level of a couple talent tiers (including his Heroics),   while bringing in a swash of baseline changes in order to make him feel a bit   more user-friendly. We realize his win rate is above average in certain MMR   brackets (and game modes) and that this may be viewed as a substantial buff to   him. However, we felt it was important to bring these changes to our players   and are prepared to act quickly if any tweaks are needed. \n\n\n\n\n[b]Level (Tier)[/b] \n[b]Gazlowe Talents[/b] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  Extra TNT (E)  [b]Scrap-o-Matic Smelter (D)[/b]  [b]Break it Down!

These fixes take many forms, and can range   from simply buffing or nerfing numbers to changing functionality.

Upon completing its quest, players will be provided with some additional   power. This allows us to offer spikes of power in-between Talent levels, or   even for a single player on a team. Now, simply picking the Talent and only   partially completing it is worse, but finishing the quest will return a larger   reward. Choosing the right Talents on the right Battleground or with the right   team composition has always been an important goal for us, and this change   pushes this Talent to closer align with that goal. \n\n              Hero Updates               [list] [b]Xplodium Charge (E)[/b] [list] [*]Stun duration reduced from 2 to 1.75 seconds.

While we want this to be a viable way to   play, we feel it’s currently too prominent and powerful at higher levels of   play. As a result, we are reducing the duration of many of these effects in   the game. In scenarios where this change nerfs a character we don’t otherwise   want to nerf, we’re coupling it with a buff to help offset the difference.   While this change hasn’t reduced all effects that might make you lose control   of your Hero, we feel these are some of the more egregious ones. As always, we   will make further changes if necessary. \n\n              Bug Fixes               [list] [*]Enemy Heroes hit by the outer edge of an Xplodium Charge will now properly refill Gazlowe’s Rock It!

[/list] [/list] [/list] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Our intention for Battle Momentum was to create   more active gameplay by using your Basic Abilities more often, but we found   that a lot of this Talent’s power lied in its ability to reduce your Heroic   cooldowns. We wanted to increase the cooldown reduction granted by the Talent,   but didn’t want Heroic Ability cooldowns to drop to absurdly low levels. By   making it only reduce the cooldowns of Basic Abilities (Q, W, E), it allowed   us to increase this cooldown reduction without making it overpowered. We’ve   also made Battle Momentum Hero-specific, so that we can tune each one without   affecting all the rest, since Attack Speed, melee versus range, and the nature   of your Basic Abilities can all drastically change what is balanced. \n\n              [b]Regeneration Master[/b] [list] A reward has been added to this Questing Talent.

Upon completing its quest, players will be provided with some additional   power. This allows us to offer spikes of power in-between Talent levels, or   even for a single player on a team. Now, simply picking the Talent and only   partially completing it is worse, but finishing the quest will return a larger   reward. Choosing the right Talents on the right Battleground or with the right   team composition has always been an important goal for us, and this change   pushes this Talent to closer align with that goal. \n\n              Hero Updates               [list] [*]Health increased from 2373 (+4% per level) to 2468 (+4% per level).

[/list] [/list] [/list] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Our intention for Battle Momentum was to create   more active gameplay by using your Basic Abilities more often, but we found   that a lot of this Talent’s power lied in its ability to reduce your Heroic   cooldowns. We wanted to increase the cooldown reduction granted by the Talent,   but didn’t want Heroic Ability cooldowns to drop to absurdly low levels. By   making it only reduce the cooldowns of Basic Abilities (Q, W, E), it allowed   us to increase this cooldown reduction without making it overpowered. We’ve   also made Battle Momentum Hero-specific, so that we can tune each one without   affecting all the rest, since Attack Speed, melee versus range, and the nature   of your Basic Abilities can all drastically change what is balanced. \n\n              Hero Updates               [list] [b]Shadow Charge (Q)[/b] [list] The implementation for this Ability has been reworked. [list] No longer automatically Stuns the target at the end of the knockback phase, and instead applies a Daze for the duration of the knockback.

[/list] [/list] [b]Apocalypse (R)[/b] [list] [*]Stun duration reduced from 2 to 1.75 seconds. [/list] [/list] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Shadow Charge seems like a really simple Ability,   but on the backend there were a lot of technical manipulations to make   everything work the way they were intended. These were starting to create odd   gameplay and bugs, so we’ve simplified the design of the Ability so that   Diablo travels right alongside his victim as they are knocked back, instead of   walking really fast toward them. \nAdditionally, we’ve received a lot of feedback from players   regarding the popular strategy of chaining movement impairing effects, like   Stuns and Roots, on an enemy Hero. While we want this to be a viable way to   play, we feel it’s currently too prominent and powerful at higher levels of   play. As a result, we are reducing the duration of many of these effects in   the game. In scenarios where this change nerfs a character we don’t otherwise   want to nerf, we’re coupling it with a buff to help offset the difference.   While this change hasn’t reduced all effects that might make you lose control   of your Hero, we feel these are some of the more egregious ones. As always, we   will make further changes if necessary. \n\n            "},{"name":"2016-03-29 Patch Notes v 17.0 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20063493","content":"\n              \n[h]Talents[/h] \n              [b]Block[/b] [list] [*]Damage reduction increased from 50% to 75% [/list] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] We want to improve counter-pick talents like Block   that are meant to be strong against certain hero types.

Chain Bomb has also evolved into a core part of the fantasy   of playing the Hero, but was tied to a level 13 Talent. We decided to embrace   this aspect of Kael’thas while introducing more counter-play to how he   explodes Living Bomb so that it’s less frustrating to play against. Kael’thas   should now be very effective at punishing enemy teams who clump together. \nWe also added many Talents to promote Flamestrike as his primary source of   damage, as well as a few higher skill-cap Talents which allow players to   better show off their mastery of the Hero. \nAll of this power comes at a price, however, and for Kael’thas it’s his   survivability. He no longer has access to Bolt of the Storm, and Arcane   Barrier’s Shield amount has been lowered and tied to a quest on Mana Addict.   While Kael’thas can dish out a ton of damage in teamfights, he should be a   much more viable target for enemy teams to focus down. \n[b]Kael'thas Talents[/b] \n\n\n\n[b]Level (Tier)[/b] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [b]1 (1)[/b]  Convection (Q)  Fel Infusion (Trait)  Mana Addict  — \n\n\n [b]4 (2)[/b]  Nether Wind (E)  [b]Energy Roil (E)[/b]  Mana Tap (Trait)  — \n\n\n [b]7 (3)[/b]  [b]Burned Flesh (Q)[/b]  [b]Gravity Crush (E)[/b]  Sunfire Enchantment (Trait)  — \n\n\n [b]10 (4)[/b]  Phoenix (R)  Pyroblast (R)  —  — \n\n\n [b]13 (5)[/b]  Pyromaniac (W)  [b]Backdraft (W)[/b]  [b]Fission Bomb (W)[/b]  — \n\n\n [b]16 (6)[/b]  Fury of the Sunwell (Q)  [b]Sun King’s Fury (W)[/b]  [b]Twin Spheres (Trait)[/b]  — \n\n\n [b]20 (7)[/b]  Rebirth (R)  Presence of Mind (R)  [b]Master of Flames (W)[/b]  Arcane Power \n\n\n[list] [*][b]Italics[/b] indicates a [b]NEW[/b] Talent [*][b]Bold[/b] indicates a [b]MOVED[/b] Talent [/list] \n            "},{"name":"2016-02-10 Balance Update v 16.1 ","url":"http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20008204","content":"\n              \n[h]Hero Updates[/h] \n              [list] [*]Basic Attack damage reduced from 87 (+4% per level) to 65 (+4% per level) Arcane Barrier (Talent) [list] [*]Shield amount decreased from 200% to 150% [*]Duration reduced from 6 to 4 seconds [/list] [b]Gravity Lapse (E)[/b] [list] [*]Stun duration reduced from 1.5 to 1.0 seconds [/list] [b]Phoenix (R)[/b] [list] [*]Cooldown increased from 40 to 60 seconds [/list] [b]Pyroblast (R)[/b] [list] [*]Damage increased from 730 (+4% per level) to 810 (+5% per level) [*]Cooldown increased from 50 to 100 seconds Presence of Mind (Talent) \n[list] [*]Cooldown reduction for Pyroblast increased from 10 to 25 seconds per enemy hero hit [/list] [/list] [/list] \n[b][b]Developer Comments:[/b][/b] Kael’thas is a powerful hero with too few   downsides.

Reducing the stun duration   makes it less frustrating to play against and adds a bit more counterplay for   the enemy team. Phoenix is the drastically favored Heroic Ability right now,   and it’s up far too often.
